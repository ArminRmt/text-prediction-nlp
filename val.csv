"AUSTRALIA TUG CREWS BAR FOREIGN CONTAINER SHIPS
  Tug crews are preventing the movement of
  foreign-flag container vessels in and out of the ports of
  Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle, shipping sources said.
      They said maritime unions imposed bans on late Wednesday
  for reasons that are obscure but seem to be linked with claims
  for a pay rise above the 10 dlrs a week awarded by the
  Arbitration Commission nationally to all workers recently.
      Only about 10 vessels are being delayed but the bans will
  affect container terminal movements and will disrupt liner
  schedules, they said.
      The dispute goes to the Commission on Monday, they said.

"BRAZIL COCOA EXPORTERS UNLIKELY TO LIMIT SALES
  Brazilian cocoa exporters are not
  likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,
  members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to
  boost world prices, trade sources said.
      They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in
  Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.
      ""The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which
  is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in
  Brazil operate at their own free will,"" a trade source said.
      The traders were responding to questions whether they would
  follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.
      The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
  Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by
  rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment
  criteria.
      ""The position of local producers is always to negotiate as
  they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think
  it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead,"" one source added.

"CANADA LUMBER EXPORTS MAY BECOME UNPROFITABLE
  Canada's softwood lumber will become
  unprofitable for some forest product producers if prices
  decline to about 175 U.S. dlrs per thousand board feet of two
  by four inch lumber from current levels of about 195 U.S. dlrs,
  Canadian Forest Industry Council chairman Adam Zimmerman told
  reporters.
      Zimmerman reiterated profitability has been hurt by a move
  by Canadian negotiators to impose last January a 15 pct export
  tax on softwood lumber shipped to the U.S. in exchange for a
  U.S. lumbermen's lobby dropping its request for a countervail
  duty.
      ""I think that there has been a falling off in the market, so
  I think there is a moderate slow down in the price now,""
  Zimmerman said at a media briefing.
      Zimmerman said the adverse impact from lower U.S. lumber
  product prices would be felt by lumber mills in eastern Canada
  first, migrating westward.
      ""The country has swallowed a time bomb and it will go off
  when times get tough,"" Zimmerman said.
      He also said the federal government should maintain the
  existing 15 pct export tax and not allow provinces to offset
  the tax with increased provincial fees for cutting lumber.

"U.K. CREDIT POLICY SEEN STEADY, DESPITE BANK DATA
  An unexpectedly heavy 4.4 billion stg
  surge in U.K. September sterling bank lending is unlikely to
  nudge the Bank of England towards tightening monetary policy as
  long as sterling remains in its present robust state,
  economists said.
      An acute crisis of confidence in equity markets over the
  past two days will in any case subdue personal consumer credit
  demand which has largely been behind growth in lending.
      ""In the normal course of events the markets would have been
  extremely worried about that figure,"" noted Peter Spencer, U.K.
  Economist with Credit Suisse First Boston.
      After an initial dip in reaction to the bank lending data,
  which compared won stg August rise, U.K.
  Government bonds (gilts) soared as investors continued to flee
  from plummetting equities into the relative security of
  government securities.
      Equity markets dropped sharply on the news, touching a
  day's low of 1,766.7 on the FTSE 100 index after the data,
  before staging a recovery. Sterling held its buoyant tone
  throughout.
      U.K. Money market rates, in a similarly calm response,
  resumed the slightly easier trend of earlier in the morning
  after little more than a token blip as the figures came out.
      Noting that such a huge rise in credit extended by banks
  would under other circumstances have prompted market fears of a
  rise in clearing bank base rates from the current 10 pct, ""With
  the financial markets doing what they're doing, that's the last
  thing the Bank of England would want to do,"" Spencer said.
      ""The monetary situation is clearly very bad but as long as
  sterling is firm, the authorities are unlikely to put rates up,""
  said Kevin Boakes, chief U.K. Economist at Greenwell Montagu
  Gilt Edged. Boakes pointed to a rise in the narrow money
  measure M0 to 5.2 pct year-on-year from August's 4.5 pct
  growth, which he said must cause some concern at the Treasury.
      But ""The fact that overall broad money growth has slowed
  down is a rather encouraging sign,"" noted Paul Temperton, U.K.
  Economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. He pointed to a
  fall in the year-on-year growth rate of the M3 broad money
  aggregate to 19.5 pct in September from August's 22 pct.
      It was concern about credit growth which prompted the Bank
  of England to engineer a one point rise in U.K. Bank base rates
  to 10 pct in early August, caution endorsed subsequently by
  news of a massive 4.9 billion stg July rise in bank lending.
      Temperton noted that a particular focus of bank worry in
  that period had been the behaviour of U.K. Asset markets.
      Housing and equities were the key two asset markets in
  influencing consumer behaviour, he said.
      In the light of the precipitous falls on U.K. Equity
  markets in the past few days, ""There will almost certainly be a
  straightforward impact on consumer spending and on retail
  sales,"" Temperton said.
      ""Almost certainly we can look forward to slower growth in
  consumer borrowing if the equity shakeout continues,"" he added.
      ""I think the stock market has decided that the bank lending
  figure is a thing of the past...We are talking about a very
  serious panic and a flight to quality,"" Spencer said.
      A U.K. Treasury official said that it was important to look
  at all the monetary information, not just the bank lending,
  adding that monetary aggregates were growing much more slowly
  than bank lending.
      Senior banking sources noted that the surge in bank lending
  was evidence of the continuing recent trend of fairly heavy
  personal sector borrowing.
      Figures from the Banking Information Service showed
  personal sector lending by U.K. Clearing banks rose by 1.66
  billion stg in September after a 978 mln stg August rise. Much
  of the rise reflected quarterly interest payments.

"INDONESIA FINDS NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS RESOURCES
  The Indonesian state-owned oil company

      ""Petroleum operations are to be carried out by Pertamina as

"PHILIPPINES APPLAUDS DEFEAT OF U.S. LABELLING BILL
  The Philippine coconut industry has
  greeted with relief the defeat in the U.S. Senate of a bill
  requiring some edible oils to be labelled as saturated fats.
      The bill, which was defeated by the Senate Agriculture
  Committee on Monday, could have cost about 60 mln dlrs a year
  in lost exports, the Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) said.
      ""Naturally, we welcomed the defeat but there is a chance the
  bill will be resurrected and attached as a rider to another
  Senate bill,"" a spokesman for the United Coconut Association of
  the Philippines (UCAP).
      PCA chairman Jose Romero noted the vote was close, with
  eight senators voting for it, 10 against and one abstaining.
      The UCAP spokesman said the American Soybean Association
  (ASA) had spent about 25 mln dlrs lobbying for the bill.
      He said the ASA also had obscured the health issue during
  the debate.
      ""Coconut oil is high in saturated fats, but unlike saturated
  animal fats, they do not enter the blood and lymph systems
  leaving fatty deposits connected to heart disease,"" he said.
      U.S. Soybean and cottonseed producers had argued that
  saturated fats cause heart disease and that the labels would
  discourage consumption by health conscious consumers in favour
  of domestic unsaturated alternatives.
      Opponents of the bill said the proposal discriminated
  against imports and would damage the Philippines, Malaysia and
  Indonesia.
      The Philippines earned 488 mln dlrs from coconut products
  in 1986, up from 477 mln in 1985, UCAP figures show.
      Exports to the United States for edible and non-edible use

"FRENCH INSTITUTE PESSIMISTIC ON 1987 GROWTH
  French gross domestic product will grow
  by only 1.5 pct in real terms this year, compared with the
  government's forecast of two to 2.5 pct growth, the private
  Institut des Previsions Economiques et Financieres pour le
  Developpement des Entreprises (IPECODE) said.
      However, it expects growth to recover next year to the 1986
  level of two pct.
      IPECODE said demand and production would develop in
  parallel this year, in contrast to last year when production
  was unable to keep pace with the strong rise in domestic
  demand, unleashing higher import demand.
      Claims on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) rose by 298
  mln francs to 19.61 billion francs, due to net withdrawals in
  francs by member nations, and an increase in reserves of
  Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) due mainly to the repayment of
  French debts.
      Its deficit with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund
  (FECOM) remained unchanged in February at 33.90 billion francs.
      French household consumption, which rose by 3.1 pct last
  year, is likely to grow by just 1.1 pct this year and 1.5 pct
  in 1988, it added.
      Industrial investment is expected to rise by 4.3 pct this
  year and 5.5 pct in 1988, down from 6.5 pct in 1986.
      Inflation, which was running at 2.1 pct at the end of 1986,
  is likely to rise to 2.9 pct at the end of this year, IPECODE
  said, while the government has forecast 2.5 pct.
      However, the institute said inflation would fall back to
  2.5 pct at the end of 1988, ""provided that real wage costs
  remain within the framework of productivity rises.""

"CANADA OUTLINES GATT AGRICULTURAL REFORM PLAN
  Canadian Trade Minister Pat
  Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world
  international trade and should therefore become more price
  responsive over time.
      She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade
  ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted
  adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture
  should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries
  should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that
  distorted world prices, Carney said.
      Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should
  not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing
  legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must
  be implemented collectively.
      Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are
  basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals
  announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.
      European trade sources said the conference welcomed the
  Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the
  European Community, voiced reservations about some of the
  principles.
      Carney said there was a lot of political will among the
  ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under
  four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to
  be done in a balanced way.
      ""The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a
  broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early
  conclusion,"" she said.
      However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are,
  Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade
  negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by

"GROUP MAY SUPPORT CARDIS CORP &lt;CDS> BUYOUT
  A group of companies controlled by

  of the company's stock.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
  the group disclosed that it currently holds a 5.5 pct stake in
  Cardis common stock, and said it ""would likely support"" an
  acquisition of the company as a whole or in parts by another
  party, terming such a move ""the most likely means for the
  company's shareholders to maximize the value of their
  investment.""
      Although the group characterized its Cardis stock holdings
  as principally for investment, it said it intends to contact
  third parties who might be interested in an acquisition of
  Cardis, a Los Angeles-based auto parts distributor.
      The group added its has already had ""some contacts"" with

"SAUDI OIL COMPANY GETS NEW ACTING GOVERNOR
  The acting governor of Saudi Arabia's
  state-owned oil company, Petromin, Jamal Hassan Jawa, has
  retired at his own request, oil industry sources said.
      They said Ali Ibrahim Rubaishi, head of organisation
  planning in Petromin, would take over as acting governor.
      Jawa held the post since his predecessor, Abdul-Hadi Taher,
  left in a major oil industry shake up last December.
      The sources said Rubaishi had not been expected to hold the
  post permanently.
      The government removed Taher and Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki
  Yamani from their posts late last year in a move which industry
  sources said was aimed at coming to grips with a buyers' oil
  market.
      The two men had run the Saudi oil industry for more than 20
  years. Industry sources said that despite huge resources, Saudi
  Arabia had been unable to mould an oil marketing strategy tuned
  to the competitive realities of the 1980s glut.
      Hisham Nazer, who replaced Yamani, successfully led an
  OPEC-engineered return to fixed oil prices of 18 dlrs a barrel
  last December.
      Nazer is believed to be reviewing Saudi oil operations
  which could lead to a thorough overhaul in the way Saudi Arabia
  does business, the sources said.
      The sources had said possible candidates for the governor's
  job include Prince Abdul Aziz Ibn Salman Ibn Abdul Aziz, who
  earlier ran a research center at Saudi Arabia's University of
  Petroleum and Minerals, and former Deputy Planning Minister
  Faisal Beshir. They also list Abdulla Bakr, President of the
  University of Petroleum and Minerals, economist Ali Jonahi,

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN SHIPBUILDERS RECOVERY
  Japan's ailing shipbuilding industry
  plans to refloat itself in a few years from the twin rocks of
  recession and a strong yen through capacity and workforce cuts
  and greater use of computers, industry sources told Reuters.
      The salvage measures, which include a government-sponsored
  rationalisation program, are aimed at clawing back some of the
  market which Japan, the world leader, has lost to South Korea
  through currency and labour cost disadvantages, they said.
      The sources said South Korea's yards are now some 35 pct
  more competitive than Japan's due to such factors.
      The government plans to help the industry shed 20 pct of
  current capacity within two years through mergers and
  regrouping under legislation put before Parliament this month
  and likely to be approved by May or June, the sources said.
      They said from September a semi-government body will assure
  repayment of about 50 billion yen in liabilities incurred
  through job losses and the sale of excess capacity, and another
  30 billion for buying unneeded land and equipment.
      Last Friday, the Shipbuilders Association of Japan applied
  to the Fair Trade Commission to form a cartel to slash tonnage
  built to about half of total capacity for a year from April 1.
      The commission has held several hearings with the industry
  and approval should be given this month, the sources said.
      A clampdown on output over one or two years combined with a
  planned cost-cutting and streamlining program and state support
  should help Japanese yards recover their international
  competitiveness, they said.
      Under the cartel proposals, 33 yards each capable of
  building ships of more than 10,000 gross tonnes would build a
  maximum of three mln compensated gross registered tonnes (CGRT)
  in 1987/88. This is about half of total capacity.
      This will ease the cut-throat competition which forced most
  yards to sign orders below cost, the sources said.
      The industry is likely to seek to renew the cartel for
  1988/89 as the Transport Ministry sees new orders falling to
  3.1 mln CGRT in 1988/89 from 3.3 mln in 1987/88, they said.
      The rationalisation program includes a cut of 20,000 to
  30,000 of the estimated 100,000 workers in the industry between
  1986 and 1989.
      Japanese yards topped world order books at end-December,
  followed by South Korea and Taiwan, according to Lloyd's
  Register of Shipping.
      However, falling orders and declining international
  competitiveness due to the strong yen led to heavy losses in
  the industry, the sources said.
      Four of Japan's six major heavy machinery and shipbuilding
  companies reported current deficits in the first half of the
  year to March 31 and five of them are expected to report
  current deficits for the whole of 1986/7, they said.
      The shipbuilding companies' streamlining program will raise
  productivity to compete with South Korean yards which have also
  been hard hit by declining orders and low ship prices in recnt
  years, the sources said.
      In Japan, no single yard leads the industry, resulting in
  fierce competition and slow progress in reducing capacity. The
  two largest firms -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd &lt;MITH.T>
  and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T> --
  account for only 30 pct of ships built, the sources said.
      ""World shipowners hope Japanese yards can manage to ride out
  the recession as their technology is the best in the world,""
  said an official at a major Japanese shipping company.
      The Japanese merchant fleet, the largest after Liberia's,
  has no intention of shifting to other countries to buy ships,
  and this will encourage Japanese yards, the sources said.

  Already strained relations between
  the U.S. And the European Community (EC) are likely to get
  worse before they get better, director general of the Dutch
  Economics Ministry's foreign affairs division Frans Engering
  said.
      Speaking at an American Chamber of Commerce lunch in The
  Hague, Engering noted the developing history of crises over
  steel, citrus and pasta, and warned of more to come.
      ""I consider the strident tone of US declarations on Airbus
  ill-advised, and the EC fats and oils tax proposal a dangerous
  provocation,"" he said. ""I feel that we shall probably have to
  deal with quite a few more crises in the foreseeable future.""
      Not only is the US Congress clearly very determined to get
  the American balance of payments into better shape, but the
  risks of brinkmanship are all the greater because the EC has
  its own constraints in meeting outside pressure, Engering
  noted.
      ""If we ask ourselves whether it is perhaps inevitable that
  we keep pushing each other to the brink of actual trade war,
  then I think the answer is probably yes,"" he said.
      In order to reduce these tensions, decision-making in the
  EC must become less self-centred, and the US Administration
  will have to exercise the authority to convince Congress and
  pressure groups of the need for accommodation, he added.

      Hofer described Lyng as ""sympathetic but noncommittal,"" and
  said he thought he detected ""a sense of frustration"" on Lyng's
  part at not being able to respond more positively to the
  group's urging.
      A grain industry representative said some participants were
  ""puzzled"" by USDA's apparent reluctance to bring before the
  cabinet council an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.
      ""There is a feeling that there is more receptivity (to the
  idea) within the cabinet council now than there ever has been,""
  this official, who asked not to be identified, said, referring
  to an EEP wheat offer to the Soviets.
      This official said there was not a significant amount of
  pressure being exerted by lawmakers on Lyng to make an EEP
  offer to Moscow.
      Reminded that Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
  Leahy (D-Vt.) had written two letters to Lyng urging such an
  offer, this official said Lyng had received virtually no phone
  calls from lawmakers on the subject.
      But Hofer said other important matters at the White House,
  rather than an absence of political pressure, might have
  restrained Lyng.

"BANKERS SEE SHARP RISE IN THAI FOREIGN RESERVES
  Thailand's improving economy will likely
  cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion
  dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at
  end-February, private bankers said.
      Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to
  3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.
      Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank
  Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively
  high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market,
  and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan,
  contributed to the projected sharp rise.
      Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to
  expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.
      A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could
  achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up
  from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.
      Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its
  current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable
  the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.
      Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold,
  special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target
  is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports.

"SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES
  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for
  the shares of companies that they must extend the period their
  offers are open if key conditions are changed.
      Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers
  for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to
  eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be
  tendered in order for the offers to be valid.
      Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.
  As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares
  that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.
      In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said
  clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender
  offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,
  even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.
      The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share
  condition is a ""material change"" of the tender offer under U.S.
  securities law, SEC officials said.
      The SEC has already said that other specific material
  changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being
  sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a
  tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.
      The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving
  shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender
  offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share
  conditions were waived.
      SEC officials said the length of the extension in such
  cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding
  each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.
      The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers
  of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each
  offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new
  information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.
      ""If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of
  its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate
  dissemination,"" the SEC said.
      Federal securities law requires that all tender offers
  remain open for at least 20 business days.

"PILLSBURY &lt;PSY> HURT BY RESTAURANT OPERATIONS
  Pillsbury Corp, reporting lower
  earnings for the third quarter ended February 28, said a strong
  performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group
  declines.
      Excluding unusual items, it said restaurants operating
  profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales
  rose four pct.
      It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higher
  operating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale,
  which introduced a new menu.
      Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger
  King's distribution arm, and said increased investment spending
  on developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill
  - hurt results.
      It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items,
  rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads
  and baking products major contributors to improvement in the
  quarter.
      A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in
  profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said.
      Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr
  profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the
  sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and
  lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early
  retirement program initiated a year ago.
      Earlier, Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5
  mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, down from 55.4 mln dlrs, or 63 cts
  a share a year ago. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion dlrs from
  1.46 billion dlrs.
      Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the
  1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced per-share earnings by nine
  cts in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months.
      As a result of the act, it said its effective income tax

"ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE
  State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce
  Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with
  many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is
  likely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus
  Industrie> A340 aircraft.
      The company's so-called ""pathfinder prospectus"" gives all the
  details of its stock market flotation except for the price at
  which shares will be offered.
      Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose
  in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.
      Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit
  for 1987.
      Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits
  and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls
  operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.
      Assuming the company was valued at around eight times
  earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about
  1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the
  aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.
      BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between
  1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.
      The price will be increased by it being likely to have much
  of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the
  company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was
  rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.
      When the government announced the sale, it said it would
  inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250
  mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.
      Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit
  rating to match those of its main competitors such as General
  Electric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Pratt

"FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES
  France's right wing government is facing
  growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising
  down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation
  forecasts for this year.
      Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector
  forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation
  estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its
  economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a
  2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last
  september.
      Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures
  would not push the government off its chosen mix of price
  deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.
      But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would
  push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising
  the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.
      And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed
  Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth
  and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year,
  perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential
  elections due by April 1988.
      ""The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago,""
  said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. ""We have the
  impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth
  this year.""
      ""The big question is whether the government's policy of wage
  moderation will be maintained,"" he added.
      The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout
  1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises
  justified by increased productivity.
      But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond
  Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already
  rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built
  into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher
  prices.
      Calling the government's policies ""unbalanced and unjust,"" he
  also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He
  announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the
  government would spend two billion francs on a series of
  measures to boost employment and training
      Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate
  Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac
  earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of
  France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings
  its top priority.
      But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and
  still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts
  said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.
      ""Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist
  government and I dont think this administration is going to
  reverse that,"" commented Michel Develle, economist at
  recently-privatised Banque Paribas.
      Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas
  and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher
  inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he
  said.
      Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more
  than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7
  per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.
      ""But that would still be an exceptional achievement
  considering that for the first time since the Second World War
  all french prices have been freed,"" he commented.
      Finance Ministry officials said that the governments
  abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible
  for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living
  costs.
      But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should
  have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.
      Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long
  as the government kept wages under control.
      Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of
  1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more
  than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute,
  INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better,
  he added.
      Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to
  help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget
  deficit, several analysts said.
      So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value
  Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a
  loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than
  expected growth, they said.

      The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr
  trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on
  the economic policies Indonesia adopted.
      But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto
  and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific
  policy changes.
      ""The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian
  government. We are not here to dictate to them,"" he stated.
      Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly
  hit by last year's slump in oil prices which cut its revenues
  from crude exports in half.
      Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning
  with Suharto.
      He voiced support for measures already taken, including
  September's 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to
  deregulate imports and stimulate exports.
      ""The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in
  a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of
  today's world,"" he said.
      The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the
  past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.
      The World Bank would probably like to see further
  dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce
  Indonesia's protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics
  and cement, western bankers and diplomats said.
      The government has already said it will announce further
  deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also
  considering selling off loss-making state companies.
      Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find
  funds to cover its share of development projects, which
  otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed. Japan's Ex-Im
  bank announced a 900 mln dlr untied credit last month.

"FERRY DISASTER MAY RANK AMONG WORST TRAGEDIES
  Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard
  a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could
  rank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies.
      Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no
  hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the
  Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian
  coast last night.
      If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's
  worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with
  a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the
  loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.
      The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was
  the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives.
      The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914
  when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland
  collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada.
      The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that
  took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was
  torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945.
      In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries
  sank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and
  147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah.

"FINAL 50/50 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 1.6 BILLION DLRS
  The Agriculture Department will have
  to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind
  certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA
  decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain
  deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.
      Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to
  feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for
  the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50
  cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they
  want to do the same for feedgrains.
      Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn
  deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42
  billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment
  must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.
      However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of
  deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs,
  doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.
      Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation
  from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge
  release of certs onto the market.
      Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final
  feedgrain deficiency payment to ""as soon as five months after
  harvest as possible,"" rather than the current year lag time.
      Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole
  (R-Kans.), sponsors of the bills, have brought the legislation
  forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions.

"(CORRECTED) - PHILIPPINES CRITICISES EC FOR OIL LEVY
  Philippines Trade and
  Industry Secretary Jose Concepcion told world trade ministers
  he wondered if their agreement was of any real value after the
  European Community (EC) proposed a levy on vegetable oils.
      Concepcion, speaking at an informal meeting of the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) here, said ministers
  declared in Uruguay last September that the trade of
  less-developed nations should not be disrupted.
      He said the EC not only ignored Manila's request for lower
  tariffs on coconut oil but proposed a levy on vegetable oils
  and fats that are vital exports for Southeast Asian countries.
      Concepcion said while the levy might be rejected by the EC
  Council of Ministers, he noted that ""I cannot help but wonder
  whether the agreements we produce in meetings like this are of
  any real value.""
      He also said industrialised nations saved about 65 billion
  U.S. Dlrs in 1985 through low commodity prices, but this had
  affected the ability of developing nations to import goods and
  services.
      ""The health and the growth of world trade requires that the
  new development of developing countries losing their share of
  world trade be arrested and reversed,"" he said.

"HK HOTELS SOARS ON TAKEOVER SPECULATION
  The price of Hongkong and Shanghai
  Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a
  takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family
  and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock
  brokers said.
      They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an
  announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land
  Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk
  Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06
  billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
      Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment
  on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.
  But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
  from Liang as long term investment.
      He said Evergo ""was attracted by the underlying strength of
  Hk Hotels.""
      Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible
  redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known
  hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by
  Hk Hotels.
      &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10
  pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.
      Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun
  on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.
      ""It is purely coincidence,"" he said.
      But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo
  group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
  up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.
      Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which
  analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael
  Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.
      Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to
  the Hk Hotels board.
      A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has
  not considered any countermoves so far.
      Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the
  Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
  styles.
      ""Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
  property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not
  fit the conservative Kadoorie family,"" said an analyst who asked
  not to be named.
      Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been
  distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
  only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai
  Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
  current trading price.
      Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,
  China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates
  Ltd>.
      Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,
  China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74
  cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs.

  External risks for the economy have

      Schroeder-Hohenwarth told a news conference the further

"WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR
  The World Bank intends to bring
  borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it
  expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank
  vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.
      He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan,
  West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. ""The weight
  of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher
  probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower
  interest rates,"" he said.
      The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far
  this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.
      The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a
  level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and
  how much to borrow, Rotberg said.
      Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years'
  anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding
  debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.
      Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it
  did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the
  sake of innovation, Rotberg said.
      Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some
  eight billion had been swapped into another currency.
      Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or
  unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that
  this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.
      The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over
  the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However,
  for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new
  instruments such as bonds with warrants.
      The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany
  since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.

"U.S. FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX
  The complex task of wielding control
  over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global
  economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices, the
  newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says.
      Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the
  making of monetary policy. But they would be given a much
  greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert
  Heller, who joined the board last August.
      He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed, but
  argues that such an arrangement, particularly if it were
  adopted by other major industrial countries, could reduce the
  volatility of exchange rates.
      Moreover, it could help stabilize of the prices of
  commodities themselves, slowing changes in inflation.
      His idea, which many conservative economists find
  appealing, has some backing among board members appointed in
  recent years by President Reagan.
      It would complement the present system of opening or
  closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation,
  key indicators such as unemployment, and the rise or fall of
  the money supply. Changes in the money supply can lead to
  changes in interest rates and affect economic activity
  directly.
      Discussed on and off for a long time, the commodity concept
  is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary
  policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid
  base.
      ""What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can
  serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary
  purposes,"" says Heller.
      In the past, this anchor was gold but the United States
  went off the gold standard because the global economy had
  vastly outstripped gold supplies.
      A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of
  hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest
  producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa.
      The so-called fixed rate system, scuttled in the early
  1970s, is still considered unworkable in the present world.
      But the current system of floating currencies in which
  currencies can fluxtuate widely, adding vast pressures to the
  monetary system, is also being widely questioned.
      Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a
  formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when
  currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are
  major problems with this also.
      For one thing, there is justifiable concern that countries
  might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be
  detrimental to their own domestic economy.
      Moreover, some question whether concerted intervention can
  make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree
  with the fundamental judgement.
      The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference
  to work out a new system that, not surprisingly, helps them
  cope with their overpowering debt problems.
      Treasury Secretary James Baker, the Reagan administration's
  chief economic architect, has preferred to use the so-called
  Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes, Seven, as a
  forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other
  economic matters.
     He appears convinced that officials from West Germany,
  France, Britain, Japan, Italy and Canada talking quietly behind
  closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public
  posturing.
     The Heller approach, while extremely complex, could have a
  profound impact on the system, ideally stabalizing prices and
  international exchange rates.
      As envisioned by Heller, a basket of say, 30 major
  commodities ranging from wheat to oil, would be put together
  and prices would be measured on a regular basis.
      ""In times of rising commodity prices, monetary policy might
  be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices, montary
  policy might be eased,"" he says.
      He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction
  markets, and a commodity price index can be calculated on a
  virtually continuous basis.
      Moreover, most commodity prices are produced, consumed and
  traded on a world-wide basis, so ""that an index has a relevance
  for the entire world,"" he says.
      In addition, commodity prices are at the beginning of the
  production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all
  production processes.
      ""Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive
  indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures,
  the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in
  making their monetary policy decisions,"" he says.
      However, he says that any major change in a basic commodity
  such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by
  the OPEC cartel, would have to be discounted in such a system.
      He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow
  monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity
  to the rest of the system and to other commodities.

"LAST-MINUTE OPPOSITION TO GULF BILL ARISES
  House Speaker Jim Wright predicted
  passage of legislation requiring the Reagan administration to
  provide Congress with a report on its Mideast Gulf policy, but
  a last-minute revolt by an alliance of liberals and
  conservatives left the bill's fate in doubt.
      The legislation was written in the wake of the May 17th
  Iraqi missile attack on the U.S. frigate Stark in the Gulf,
  which killed 37 Americans, and President Reagan's decision to
  protect 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers by putting them under U.S. flags
  -- effectively making them American ships.
      Since the administration made known its reflagging plans,
  congressional leaders complained they had not been consulted,
  and some charged the policy could lead the United States into
  the 6 1/2-year-old war between Iran and Iraq.
      The House was to vote today on a bill -- supported by the
  Democratic and Republican congressional leadership and the
  administration -- which demanded a report within seven days on
  plans to meet the security needs of U.S. forces in the gulf.
      The resolution was expected to pass without controversy
  today in the House Foreign Affairs Committee before the full
  House was to take up the bill. But in a surprise move, liberal
  Democrats and conservative Republicans on the committee joined
  in an unusual alliance to oppose the resolution.
      Liberal Democrats said a lack of any restrictions in the
  bill implied consent to Reagan's policies.

"VOLVO GROUP COMPANY PROPOSES TWO-FOR-FIVE ISSUE
  &lt;AB Catena>, in which AB Volvo
  &lt;VOLV.ST> has a 48 pct stake, said it was proposing a
  two-for-five stock issue that will raise the company's equity
  capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln.
      Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up
  to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an
  increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in
  1985.
      The company said that its 1986 performance was best
  reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln
  from 221 mln in 1985.
      Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover
  of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business
  profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo
  dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a
  trading and industrial company.
      In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking
  firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB. This yielded a
  profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena's
  pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in
  1985.

"ANALYSTS SAY U.K. BUDGET POINTS TO BASE RATE CUTS
  Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson's Budget speech was described as sound and well balanced
  by analysts, if slightly lacking in excitement.
      A cut in bank base lending rates is now widely expected
  tomorrow, with most forecasts predicting a half-point fall. A
  follow-up half-point cut is anticipated next week.
      ""Worthy but boring would probably sum it up,"" Peter Fellner,
  U.K. Economist at stockbrokers James Capel and Co, said. ""It was
  a very, very prudent fiscal budget.""
      Richard Jeffrey of brokers Hoare Govett said it was a
  well-balanced budget within the confines of the government's
  philosophy of keeping expenditure levels flat.
      Most analysts said the Budget was very sound on the fiscal
  side, but offered nothing new on monetary policy.
      As was widely expected, Lawson split his ""fiscal adjustment""
  between trimming the 1987/88 PSBR target to 4.0 billion stg
  from 7.1 billion and cutting basic rate income tax from 29 to
  27 pct.
      The target for the narrow measure of money supply, M0, was
  kept unchangd at two to six pct, while the target for the broad
  Sterling M3 aggregate was dropped.
      Both Jeffrey and Fellner said the budget clears the way for
  a half-point fall in U.K. Base rates tomorrow, but the
  authorities are unlikely to sanction a larger cut immediately.
  Many analysts and currency dealers have forecast a full
  one-point cut tomorrow.
      ""The Bank of England will be loathe to take any action which
  it will have to reverse later,"" Jeffrey said, though he added a
  further half-point cut was quite possible in the near future.
      The main worry from today's speech is the outlook for
  inflation, given the signs of relaxed monetary policy contained
  in it, Scrimgeour Vickers economist Richard Holt said.
      Holt noted the ""rather loose"" inflation forecast of 4.0 pct
  at end-1987, and said the lower interest rates likely to result
  from the tough fiscal stance could cause longer term concern.
      ""A higher PSBR target could be preferable in the long term,""
  he said, although lower mortgage interest rates on the back of
  falling base rates would have an offsetting impact on
  inflation.
      The Budget will inspire a lot of short-term confidence but
  it was ""not a good budget for inflation,"" he said
      Jeffrey said he would have liked Lawson to say more about
  the dangers of excessive liquidity build-up but overall was not
  too concerned about a revival of inflation.
      Fellner noted that the exchange rate was to remain the
  ""leading edge"" of monetary policy, but said the authorities were
  likely to be extremely cautious on this front.
      He said they were unlikely to hesitate in holding interest
  rates steady or even raising them again if sterling showed any
  signs of excessive weakness.
      Most analysts agreed Lawson had bolstered the credibility
  of the Budget by adopting realistic forecasts.
      Raising the forecast for the current account deficit from
  1.5 to 2.5 billion stg for 1987 would not unsettle the markets,
  which are already discounting that amount, Jeffrey said.
  that the 4.0 billion stg PSBR target was given credibility by
  the favourable outturn for 1986/87, which is now also forecast
  to be 4.0 billion stg.
      But analysts said the Budget speech did not give any
  clear-cut indication about the timing of the general election,
  which has to be held before June, 1988.
      Some believe it signals a poll this June, noting that the
  benefits, such as income tax cuts and the decision not to raise
  duties on alcohol and tobacco, become available immediately.
      But others said it kept several options open and it was not
  possible to deduce too much from it.
      James Capel's Fellner noted that by being fiscally prudent,
  Lawson had kept open the possibility of an autumn election in
  that there would be no ""chickens coming home to roost.""
      Richard Jeffrey, who favours the likelihood of a June
  election, said it was important the Chancellor had not gone for
  a Budget aimed overtly at buying an election victory.
      Nevertheless, he said, it was likely to result in a boost
  to the Conservative Party's pre-election popularity.

"PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT
  The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co
  &lt;PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct
  stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market
  buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.
      Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the
  company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.
      He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18
  mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15
  1987. ""The exercise should make our stock more marketable,"" Lazo
  said. ""Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors.""
      PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February
  1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila
  Stock Exchange.
      Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,
  would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.
      PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
  pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
  billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
      At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
      A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
  be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
  three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
  from which it was previously exempt.
      The government has not so far ordered the implementation of
  the tax decision.
      PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the
  Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014
  telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments
  in the country.

"CBI SURVEY POINTS TO SURGE IN U.K. OUTPUT
  British manufacturers expect output to
  grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of
  British Industry (CBI) survey shows.
      The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct
  of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the
  next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47
  pct said production would likely remain unchanged.
      The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting
  production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was
  the highest such figure recorded since 1977.
      In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected
  a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain
  at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.
      The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies
  consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct
  view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below
  normal.
      This was the highest positive balance since the question
  was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.
      In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct
  respectively.
      Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of
  all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to
  be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only
  23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.
      In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below
  normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,
  the proportion of companies rating their export books above
  normal was unchanged between February and March.
      On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies
  expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will
  remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in

"JOHN LABATT SEES GOOD FOURTH QUARTER, YEAR
  &lt;John Labatt Ltd> anticipates a good

  financial analysts.
      He would not make any specific forecast, but said he was
  optimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company's
  brewing and food products operations.
      Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months
  ended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. Revenue for the
  nine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs.

  including 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S.
      Labatt, Canada's leading brewer, has expanded in the U.S.
  food products industry by acquisitions.
      Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansion
  stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian
  food and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for this
  year will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, he

      In the second half of 1986 net earnings were 2,297,000
  dlrs, or 29 cts per share.
      The company said the charges relate to its
  telecommunications products area and three other areas.
      California Microwave previously estimated the write-downs
  in the six to eight-mln-dlr range. It said it will add to that
  a reserve for investment losses in Argo Communications Corp.
      Also to be included in the write-down are charges against
  its advances to an Arizona-based communications electronics
  firm the company has an option to acquire, it said.
      In addition, accruals are being made for costs associated
  with the company's reduction in its Sunnyvale work force.
      California Microwave said the write-downs should have a
  nominal cash impact, as the company already has paid for the
  assets being written down.

"SOVIET ECONOMIST SEES FEW GAINS IN U.S. TRADE
  There is little chance Soviet exports
  to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's current
  trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods
  in future, a Soviet economist said.
      Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an
  agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a
  U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items
  that western nations want.
      But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and
  allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage
  modest export gains in future.
      Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of
  goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion
  dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.
      But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total
  trade between the two countries would remain between two and
  three billion dlrs a year.
      ""The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit
  its trading with the U.S.,"" he said.

"CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987
  China's grain imports will rise
  in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand, but
  will be not be as large as in the past, Chinese officials and
  Japanese traders told Reuters.
      They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy
  would not allow a return to large-scale imports, which peaked
  at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982.
      An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put
  maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year, against 7.73
  mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985.
      Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor
  harvest and rising domestic demand, but remained below exports,
  which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985.
      ""China is short of foreign exchange,"" the Shanghai official
  said. ""We cannot rely on imports, even at current low world
  prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a
  major importer.""
      A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports
  would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought,
  low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and
  animal consumption.
      ""At current prices, China loses yuan on every tonne of grain
  it exports, though it earns foreign exchange which it badly
  needs,"" the trader said.
      The People's Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is
  affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land, which will reduce
  the summer grain harvest from last year's level.
      The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying
  enough attention to agriculture, especially grain, making it
  difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln
  tonnes against 391 mln in 1986.
      ""All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest
  area, especially of corn, sweet potatoes, paddy rice and
  high-yield cash crops,"" it said.
      It added factory production might have to be reduced to
  provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight
  the drought.
      Since January, the press has devoted much attention to
  grain, stressing that growth in output is vital to China's
  economic and political stability and that prices paid to
  farmers are too low.
      Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain
  production is a key state policy and outlined the measures
  being taken in their areas to encourage output.
      The Shanghai official said that in one suburb, 10 pct of
  the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise
  agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set
  aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the
  70,000 workers available to help farmers.
      Chu Jinfeng, an official of Fengbing county outside
  Shanghai, said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three
  years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.
      Pan Huashan, an official of the agricultural department of
  Zhejiang Province, said rural industry also subsidises grain
  output in his province.
      ""In addition, we are setting up grain production bases,
  raising the level of science and technology on the farms and
  improving the supply of raw materials, roads and other
  infrastructure,"" he said.
      The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in
  industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their
  spare time, or let other family members farm it. In some cases,
  they lease the land to grain farmers.
      The China Daily said last month that grain output should
  reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480
  and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made
  profitable.
      ""The advantages the state promises grain growers actually
  yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by
  intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.
  Only this will boost enthusiasm,"" it said.

"EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE
  The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of
  social and structural measures agreed early today by European
  Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers
  for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission
  sources said.
      The ministers agreed that under this ""extensification""
  scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut
  output of specific products by at least 20 pct.
      The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and
  wine, they added.
      Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by
  reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their
  number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case,
  farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity
  for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.
      The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but
  will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on
  the production they forego.
      The sources said the package also contains provisions for
  payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting
  or improving the environment.
      It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured
  farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such
  allowances are available only for livestock.
      The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into
  alternative farming techniques, the sources added.
      At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen
  said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the
  EC and member states to provide direct income supports for
  relatively poor farmers.
      Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state
  aid would be subject to ""strict criteria to avoid distortion of
  competition.""
      EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a
  difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus
  production.
      The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night
  proposals to pay ""early retirement"" pensions to farmers aged 55
  or over who gave up production. Those who took their land
  completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to
  their heirs, would have received more generous payments.
      Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised
  proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme
  agreed.

"BANGLADESH'S TRADE GAP TO WIDEN IN 1987/88
  Bangladesh's trade gap is expected to
  widen in fiscal 1987/88 beginning on July 1 after the
  government relaxed restrictions on some imports including
  luxury cars.
      The country has set its export target for the year at 1.1
  billion U.S. Dlrs against imports of 1.805 billion dlrs,
  compared with 1986/7's one billion dlrs of export earnings and
  1.113 billion dlrs of imports.
      Commerce Minister Mohammad Abdul Munim said the changes
  were aimed at encouraging export oriented industries to boost
  foreign exchange earnings and imports of essential machinery
  and raw materials, to increase industrial production.
      The government was easing procedures to enhance incentives
  especially for exporters of textiles and frozen food and
  importers of industrial machinery and raw materials, Munim told
  reporters.
      Commerce Ministry officials told Reuters the import policy
  covered only commercial imports amounting to 1.805 billion
  dlrs. Imports of capital machinery and foodgrains by the
  government were not included in the policy, they added.
      They said the country's total import bill (both commercial
  and other imports) was expected to reach 2.7 billion dlrs in
  the new year compared with 2.4 billion dlrs in 1986/87.
      The minister said ending restrictions on imports of cars
  and dropping 50 pct sales tax on small cars would not harm the
  economy.
      Munim said Bangladesh feared a further drop in prices for
  its main export jute, ""which will certainly affect our export
  earnings"" in the coming year.
      Bangladesh's jute exports fell to 410 mln dlrs from 500 mln
  in 1986/87, according official figures.
      But Munim said exports of non-traditional items, which
  accounted for over 40 pct of total exports this year, would
  play a key role in achieving the 1987/88 export target.

  Monetary and credit growth rates in

  following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late

      The monetary and credit growth figures for the December

      Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is
  expected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this year

      But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to be
  approximately offset by a number of factors, including a
  somewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation
  segment than in 1986, financing costs of the AccuRay
  acquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRay
  technology and operations and delays in waste to energy
  projects.

"SUMITA SAYS HE DOES NOT EXPECT FURTHER DOLLAR FALL
  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
  said he does not expect the dollar to remain unstable and fall
  further.
      He told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament that
  the Bank of Japan would continue to cooperate closely with
  other major nations to stabilize exchange rates.
      The central bank has been keeping extremely careful watch
  on exchange rate movements since last week, he said.
      He said the dollar would not continue to fall because of
  underlying market concern about the rapid rise of the yen.
      Sumita said the currency market has been reacting to
  overseas statements and to trade tension between Japan and the
  U.S. Over semiconductors.
      The yen's tendency to rise will prevent Japan from
  expanding domestic demand and undertaking necessary economic
  restructuring, he said.

"AUSTRALIAN OIL INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE TAX CAMPAIGN
  The council of the
  Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) said it
  will press on with its campaign for major improvements to
  Australia's petroleum taxation structure.
      The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly
  disappointed by the Australian government's position on
  taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy
  Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.
      As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target
  any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to
  secondary taxation of petroleum.
      APEA had expected the government to make positive responses
  to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of
  existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and
  development, the council said.
      It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by
  Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed
  with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.
      Evans told the conference the government did not plan to
  accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow
  deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.
      ""The government's unwillingness to allow the deduction of
  unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore
  area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is
  profit based,"" the APEA council said.
      The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil
  exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the
  industry's concerns, despite its recognition of the industry's
  problems, the council said.
      The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory
  secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major
  disincentives at a time of low oil prices.

"GERMAN CALL MONEY EASES AFTER LIQUIDITY INJECTION
  Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from
  3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion
  marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's
  securities repurchase agreement, dealers said.
      But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.
      A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers,
  payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of
  mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the
  Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System
  (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks
  built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.
      The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion
  marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as
  an earlier securities repurchase pact matured.
      Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six
  billion marks.
      The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said
  yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll
  over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to
  redeem them meant a net infusion was needed.
      Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks,
  but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.
      Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled
  53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the
  first nine days of March.
      Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected
  requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of
  funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet
  the requirement toward the end of March.
      No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week,
  but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if
  conditions significantly tighten. ""The Bundesbank wants to keep
  rates around 3.80 pct,"" one dealer said.

  December, the government's Management and Coordination Agency

      Unemployment was up from 2.8 pct a year earlier.
      Unadjusted January unemployment totalled 1.82 mln people,
  up from 1.61 mln in December and 1.65 mln a year earlier.
      Male unemployment in January remained at 2.9 pct, equal to

      Female unemployment in January remained at 3.0 pct, equal
  to the record level marked in April, August, September and

      January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed

"BRAZIL TRADE SURPLUS RISES IN FEBRUARY
  The trade surplus doubled in
  february to 261 mln dlrs from January's 129 mln, but was  below
  the 628 mln of February 1986, official figures show.
      The director of the Banco do Brasil's foreign trade
  department (CACEX), Roberto Fendt, told reporters the upturn in
  February confirmed a rising trend in exports, which totalled
  1.53 billion dlrs against 1.26 billion in January and, after
  excluding coffee and oil derivitives, was only slightly below
  the same month last year.
      Coffee earnings were down to 110 mln dlrs against 295 mln
  in February 1986 because of lower prices, he added.
      Fendt said that although the February results were lower
  than the average expected for the rest of the year, the
  government's target of an eight-billion-dlr surplus for 1987
  should be achieved. This would compare with a 1986 surplus of
  9.5 billion dlrs.
      Exports this year are expected to total 22.5 billion dlrs
  and imports 14.5 billion, he added. In 1986 exports totalled
  22.4 billion dlrs and imports 12.9 billion.
      Fendt said the rise in imports in February to 1.27 billion
  dlrs from 1.12 billion in February last year was in line with
  government plans to foster economic growth.
      Fendt said that imports were running at levels well above
  the traditional average for Brazil.
      In the first two months of the year imports, excluding oil
  and wheat totalled, 1.8 billion dlrs against 1.47 billion in
  the same 1986 period.
      This rise in import demand reflected the needs of Brazilian
  industry to equip to raise production and is perfectly
  compatible with the government's program for economic growth,
  Fendt added.

"BRAZIL TEMPORARILY LEGALISES DLR PARALLEL MARKET
  Brazilian President Jose Sarney
  announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of

      In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face
  ""current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the
  purchase of goods.""
      The parallel market, although officially tolerated, is
  technically illegal in Brazil. For the past year, the dollar in
  the parallel market has sold at between 25 and 100 pct above
  the official rate.
      Sarney's decision means Brazilian importers of machinery
  and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in the

  from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade Department (Cacex).
      Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an

"ETHIOPIA MINISTER SEES AFRICA DEBT PAYMENT PROBLEM
  Africa may have to follow Brazil in
  halting foreign debt payments unless industrialised nations are
  prepared to be more flexible in trade and economic policy,
  Ethiopian trade minister Tesfay Dinka said.
      Growing protectionism and declining commodity prices had
  caused a major deterioration in the export earnings of all
  developing countries, he said in an opening speech to a meeting
  of African trade ministers in Addis Ababa.
      Unless there was an early improvement in developing
  countries' terms of trade ""the only choice is to follow the
  route that Brazil appears to have taken,"" Tesfay said.
     The two-day meeting of delegates from 50 African states was
  called to work out a consensus ahead of the Group of 77
  ministerial meeting in Havana next month, when the developing
  countries will debate their strategy in economic negotiations
  with the West.
      Tesfay accused the West of intransigence in the negotiation
  of recent commodity agreements.
      The failure of the International Coffee Organisation to
  agree on the reintroduction of export quotas would mean ""several
  African countries will not have the foreign exchange to import
  essential items,"" he said.
      Coffee accounts for 60 pct of Ethiopian exports and the
  recent fall in world coffee prices has sharply reduced the
  country's foreign exchange earnings.
      Adebayo Adedeji, the executive secretary of the U.N.
  Economic Commission for Africa, told the meeting that there was
  an increasing net outflow of resources from Africa.
      He blamed this on high interest rates, debt servicing and
  the repatriation of profits by foreign investors.
      Africa paid 13 billion dlrs to service its total foreign
  debt last year and by 1990 annual service payments are expected
  to rise to between 16 and 24 billion, Adedeji said.
      He accused industrialised countries of failing to provide
  more resources to implement the U.N. Program for Africa's
  economic recovery and development, despite Africa's willingness
  to raise two thirds of the capital from domestic sources.
      The U.N. Program, approved last year, calls for 128 billion
  dlrs of economic investment in Africa over five years.
      Western donors were asked to contribute 46 billion dlrs,
  with the rest being raised from local resources, but Adedeji

"FERC DECISION COULD CUT COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> NET
  Columbia Gas System Inc said a
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural
  gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25
  dlrs a share.
      The company said ""this could bring earnings for 1987 below
  Columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs
  per share dividend."" It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.
      It said management expects to recommend to the board that
  the dividend rate be maintained in 1987.
      Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be
  offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax
  liabilities under the new federal tax laws.
      The company recorded these liabilities based on older,
  higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the
  Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of
  about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.
      ""Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987
  earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned,""
  Columbia Gas said.
      Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the
  recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas
  Transmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.
      It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased
  gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to
  amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase
  contracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary
  failed to sufficiently support cost recovery.
      The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from
  making a new filing to provide sufficient support.

"CANADIAN IMPERIAL SEES LOWER LOAN LOSSES
  &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,
  earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended
  January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last
  year's 697.0 mln dlrs.
      However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of
  provisioning for loan losses established last year because of
  many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss
  provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.
      The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5
  mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic
  share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.
      Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used
  an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in
  calculating first quarter results.
      The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to
  172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.
      Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an
  agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against
  loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal
  government's Inspector General of Banks.
      First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest
  income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.
      Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to
  213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income
  was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,
  non-interest expenses and income taxes.
      The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92
  billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly
  to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.
      Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100
  dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,
  but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.
      The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4
  billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion
  dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from
  fiscal 1986 year-end.
      ""Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of
  interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans
  to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987,
  and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings
  prior to the announcement,"" Commerce bank said.
      The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on
  future earnings by Brazil's suspension of interest payments.

"BANKERS TRUST &lt;BT> PUTS BRAZIL ON NON-ACCRUAL
  Bankers Trust New York Corp said it has
  placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term
  loans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter
  net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.
      U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop
  accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,
  but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of ""the high
  potential of a continued suspension that would result in
  reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.""
      Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are
  received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that
  full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.
      Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations
  between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the
  resumption of interest payments.
      The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central
  bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a
  90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that

"PHILADELPHIA EXCHANGE TO EXTEND HOURS FOR ASIA
  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange (PHLX),
  a leading trader of currency options, plans to extend its
  trading hours to serve Australasian and Far Eastern markets,
  exchange president Nicholas Giordano said.
      He told reporters the PHLX will open a new session between
  1900 and 2300 hours U.S. EST from the beginning of the third
  quarter this year.
      The PHLX is also opening an office in Hong Kong to serve
  clients in the region and educate financial markets about the
  advantages of currency options, Giordano said.
      Giordano was in Sydney to start an Asian-Pacific tour by
  exchange executives promoting the hedging benefits of the
  exchange-trade currency option market against existing
  over-the-counter option trading during the local working day.
      Currency options pioneered by the PHLX in 1982 had become
  an accepted means of hedging against foreign exchange risk and
  had grown in popularity, he said.
      The PHLX now offered options in eight currencies, including
  a new Australian dollar option, and traded an average 42,000
  contracts daily with underlying open interest of more than 30
  billion U.S. Dlrs.
      Giordano said the exchange had been impressed with the
  performance of its Australian dollar contract, which since its
  introduction last year had regularly topped the French franc as
  the third most popular traded option, with up to 8,000
  contracts traded daily.
      Having the Philadelphia exchange open during the
  Asia-Pacific market day would open new hedging opportunities,
  set a truer level for over-the-counter option trading, increase
  arbitraging opportunities and give corporations and treasuries
  access to a currency option market of much greater depth and
  liquidity with the security of a clearing house, he said.

"DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL
  A large Dutch animal feed compounder
  will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test
  case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied,
  a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association, Het
  Comite, told Reuters.
      Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against
  alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and,
  since December, has lodged more than 80 individual cases with
  the Business Appeal Court in The Hague.
      The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account
  of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders
  in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in
  their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another
  country.
      Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that
  companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy
  rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain
  commodity board.
      The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and
  legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration
  Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.
      The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company
  for the test case from among the 80 lodged ""because the bill
  (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the
  levy contained significant currency distortions and involved
  grain from a wide variety of origins."" The name of the company
  is not being made public.
      The Administration Court is not expected to make a final
  ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman
  said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal
  Court in Luxembourg, and ""as a result it could easily be another
  nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.""
      Meanwhile, the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are
  putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch
  government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a
  complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is
  collected, the spokesman said.
      Het Comite, as a member of FEFAC, the association of
  European animal feed manufacturers, is also a party to actions
  protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court.

"U.S. EEP VEG OIL PROPOSALS STILL UNDER REVIEW
  U.S. Agriculture Department
  proposals to offer 260,000 tonnes of subsidized vegetable oil
  to four countries are still under consideration by an

"COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S.
  Failure of talks on re-establishing
  International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week
  may put political pressure on the United States, particularly
  the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is
  unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by
  ""objective criteria"", U.S. officials said.
      Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head
  of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his
  return from London that the United States is willing to resume
  the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.
      Rosenbaum said the United States will be ""flexible"" in
  discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and
  any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of
  establishing an objective method of setting quotas.
      At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S.,
  proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated
  by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable
  production and verified stocks, while large producers led by
  Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of
  shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the
  market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.
      Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support
  legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S.
  customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply
  with any future coffee quotas.
      He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the
  coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London
  talks, but ""nobody is proposing we change our position.""
      However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee
  policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market
  offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia,
  to soften the consumer position.
      ""Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will
  kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and
  consumers,"" said one U.S. official.
      The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said
  Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few
  months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other
  countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers
  who differed with the major producers in London.
      This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin
  American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the
  U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in
  the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S.
  officials said.
      The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee
  policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from
  politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S.
  officials said.
      El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia
  at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on
  objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica
  joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to
  objective criteria.
      There is a strong feeling among some in the State
  Department that the United States should continue to support
  the splinter group of producers who have taken the
  politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective
  criteria question, U.S. officials said.
      Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be
  some pressure to reassess positions.
      In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the
  Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on
  the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.
      This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations
  to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.
      However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at
  times qualified and there is some concern that the European
  Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to
  producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and
  other African producers during the talks.
      A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult,
  although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.
      While political manuevering by small producers and
  consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the
  key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.
      U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the
  failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from
  Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.

"PHILIPPINE COFFEE EXPORTS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY
  Philippine coffee exports are expected
  to fall sharply due to a combination of the International
  Coffee Organisation's (ICO) decision not to revive export
  quotas and higher local prices, ICO Certifying Agency official
  Dante de Guzman told Reuters.
      He said exporter registrations dropped from an average
  weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week, with exports
  in coffee year 1986/87, ending September, forecast to total
  about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985/86.
       ""Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices,
  it has become difficult to service exports,"" de Guzman said,
  adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude.
      Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about
  one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986/87 crop year ending June
  from 1.1 mln bags last year, he said.

"NO REASON TO CUT RATES - BUNDESBANK'S SCHLESINGER
  Bundesbank vice president Helmut
  Schlesinger said he saw no reason to lower interest rates now.
      With money supply growth showing no sign of slowing down in
  May and the dollar stable or even rising against the mark,
  Schlesinger told Reuters that he was not convinced that a
  further cut in interest rates was needed.
      The economy is picking up, after contracting by a
  seasonally adjusted 1/2 to one pct in the first quarter from
  the fourth, he added. ""We may have an increase in gnp starting
  in the second quarter,"" he said in an interview.
      Concerned by the first quarter downturn, the U.S. Has been
  pressing West Germany to pump up its economy and boost its
  imports, either through fiscal or monetary policy.
      Schlesinger said the contraction in the first quarter was
  mainly due to adverse weather conditions, just as occured in
  1986. Year-on-year growth was thus about two pct.
      He estimated that economic growth for the year as a whole
  would probably be between one and two pct.
     ""It is not a question of monetary conditions if domestic
  demand does not grow strongly,"" he said, noting that interest
  rates are at historically low levels and funds are ample.
      Schlesinger said he saw no signs that central bank money
  stock growth was slowing down from its recent year-on-year pace
  of 7-1/2 to eight pct, well above the Bundesbank's three to six
  pct target.
      He said the target could still be achieved but much will
  depend on the direction of long-term capital flows. Heavy
  inflows, particularly in January around the time of the EMS
  revaluation, boosted domestic money supply.
      ""There is still a certain hope that the net inflow of
  foreign money can be diminished or can even be a little bit
  reversed,"" Schlesinger said.
      A major reason for the inflows was the market's conviction
  that the mark was headed higher. ""As we can see from the market,
  expectations for a further revaluation of the deutschemark have
  diminished,"" Schlesinger said.
      The recent widening of interest rate differentials, the
  fact that the dollar has fallen sharply in a very short period
  and an improvement in real trade balances have all combined
  towards stabilizing the dollar, he said.
      Asked if central banks might act to prevent a sharp dollar
  rise, as the U.S. Did in March when the dollar rose above 1.87
  marks, he said this would depend on the circumstances.
      At midday here, the dollar stood at 1.8340/45 marks.
      ""Central banks are always in contact about these
  fluctuations but I cannot give any answer how they would react,""
  Schelsinger said.
      ""One has to look at how it (the market) is moving,"" he said,
  adding, ""It is not only our own case, it is also the American
  case.""
      He said that the West German export industry has been hit
  hard by the dollar's sharp fall and would probably like to see
  some correction now. ""But it wouldn't be good to have short-term
  fluctuations,"" he said. ""Let us wait and see.""
      ""It is mainly the strength of the (dollar) fall in a very
  short period which was a little bit of a shock, than the level
  (of rates) as such,"" Schlesinger said.
      The sharp rise of the mark, coupled with weak prices of
  such key commodities as oil, had a favourable impact on West
  German inflation down year.
      Although there have recently been signs of inflation
  picking up, he said that this was due to changes in key
  commodity prices. The underlying inflation rate this year would
  be unchanged, at about one to 1-1/2 pct, he said.
      Schlesinger said the problem of rapid money supply growth
  was longer term, in that the economy was building up the
  potential for a possible eventual resurgence of inflation.
      The above-target growth of money supply over the past 16
  months had prompted some discussion of the usefulness of
  targets themselves, a matter which might be taken up at the
  mid-year meeting of the Bundesbank's council, Schlesigner said.
      But he added: ""I don't see any great pressure to go away
  from it.""

"GATT MEETING HEARS PLEA FOR AFRICAN DEBT RELIEF
  Debt among African countries
  will continue to grow and their economies remain stifled unless
  developed countries lower their interest rates, Nigerian Trade
  Minister Samaila Mamman said.
      He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed and
  developing countries and an inequitable international economic
  system were major impediments to growth in developing
  countries.
      Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in
  the New Zealand resort of Taupo.
      ""I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the
  external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full
  effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the
  developed market economy countries,"" Mamman said.
      ""The developed market economy countries have slowed down
  output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity
  exports of African countries.""
      Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a
  year would be needed over the next five years for the African
  continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth
  (GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.
      Yet at the same time Africa's debt service was estimated at
  24.5 billion dlrs a year between 1986 and 1990.
      ""With the best of intentions Africa cannot attain a three to
  four pct GDP growth rate if the current high level of debt
  persists,"" Mamman said. Developed countries must seek
  alternatives to policies that resulted in the transfer of
  resources and more indebtedness, he said.
      ""The international community cannot fail to respond
  positively to the collapse of the international market for
  commodities ... And act quickly to stabilize demand and prices
  of our commodity exports,"" he added.

"TOKYO BIDS TO STOP CHIP ROW TURNING INTO TRADE WAR
  Japan is seeking to prevent its computer
  chips dispute with the U.S. From erupting into a full-scale
  trade war, government officials said.
      ""We hope that the dispute on this specific issue won't have
  an adverse effect on our overall relationship with the United
  States,"" a Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
  official said.
       On Friday, Washington announced plans for as much as 300
  mln dlrs in tariffs on Japanese electronic goods for Tokyo's
  alleged failure to live up to a bilateral computer chip pact.
      That agreement, reached last year after heated
  negotiations, called on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips
  in world markets and to buy more American-made semiconductors.
      Foreign Ministry officials immediately tried to isolate the
  fall-out from the dispute by seeking to separate it from Prime
  Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's planned trip to Washington at the
  end of April.
      While Japan has already done about all it can to make sure
  the chip pact is working, the government is studying measures
  it can take in other fields to defuse American anger and ensure
  the trip's success, they said.
      ""The perception of Japan in the (U.S.) Congress is very bad,""
  one official told Reuters. ""We would very much like to do
  something to respond to that.""
      In an apparent effort to prevent the chip dispute from
  spreading to other areas, MITI officials sought to depict the
  U.S. Action as a severe warning to Japanese semiconductor
  makers, not to the government.
      Faced with a belligerent domestic chip industry and an
  angry American Congress, the Japanese government has been
  forced to walk an increasingly fine line in the semiconductor
  dispute, trade analysts said.
      They said that it was an open secret that Japan's largest
  chip maker, NEC Corp, was not happy with what it viewed as the
  draconian measures MITI was taking to implement the pact,
  included enforced production cuts.
      The angry response of Japanese chip makers yesterday to the
  announcement of the U.S. Tariffs highlighted the difficulties
  the government faces in taking further action.
      ""Japanese semiconductor manufacturers have complied with the
  U.S./Japan agreement,"" said Shoichi Saba, Chairman of the
  Electronic Industries Association of Japan.
      He accused the U.S. Of being ""irrational."" He said the U.S.
  Action had made the bilateral chip pact ""meaningless.""
      Saba's comments contrasted with those of Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone, who said Tokyo wanted to solve the dispute
  through consultations.
      Japan is expected to send a high-level official to
  Washington early next month to try to convince the U.S. Not to
  go ahead with the tariffs on April 17.
      Trade analysts say Tokyo is likely to outline industry
  plans to step up purchases of U.S. Chips and to propose a joint
  investigation into Washington's allegations of chip dumping.

"DLR FALLS ON FEARS, MIYAZAWA SAYS

  to the perception inside and outside Japan that the country has
  failed to fulfill its promise to expand domestic demand.
      He told a Lower House budget committee in Parliament that
  it was natural for other nations to think that Japan is not
  doing enough because of the delay in the passage of the 1987/88

      The budget has been delayed by opposition boycotts of

"NORWAY APPROVES TRADE BAN AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA
  Norway's parliament has approved an
  extensive trade ban against South Africa but left shipowners a
  key loophole through which controversial oil shipments on
  Norwegian tankers may continue, government officials said.
      The unilateral boycott, proposed by Norway's minority
  Labour government, gives domestic companies until late
  September to cut remaining trade ties with South Africa and
  Namibia.
      ""The legislation discussed today must not be seen as an
  isolated measure, but as a step in an international process,""
  Norway's foreign minister Thorvald Stoltenberg told parliament.
      Government officials said they hope the move will intensify
  international pressure against the Pretoria regime's apartheid
  policies. Sweden, in a similar move last week, promised to halt
  all trade with South Africa by October.
      Norway's boycott, although forbidding crude oil shipments
  to South Africa on Norwegian-owned tankers, makes an important
  exception for ships whose final destination is decided while
  they are at sea.
      Oil cargoes are often resold by trades after loading,
  making it difficult for shipowners to know their ships' final
  port at the start of a voyage.
      Critics said the bill leaves the door open for continued
  oil shipments to South Africa. They called for stricter
  sanctions to stop all Norwegian shipping to South Africa.
      Norwegian tankers supplied South Africa with about 30 pct
  of its crude imports during the early 1980s, but the trade has
  dropped sharply to just one cargo in the last three months,
  trade ministry officials said.
      The latest trade figures show Norwegian imports from South
  Africa dropped 36 pct to 160 mln crowns during the first eight
  months of 1986, while exports plunged 52 pct to 265 mln crowns
  from the year-ago figure.
      ""Many would say that the law has already had its effect
  because of the dramatic drop in trade between South African and
  Norway,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Per Paust told Reuters.
      ""Norwegian business at an early stage started restructuring
  its relations with South Africa in anticipation of the law.
      ""No one has said the boycott will have a profound effect on
  international trade with South Africa, but it is an important
  political statement by the Norwegian government,"" he said.
      The Oslo government said it will review the effects of the
  ban on Norwegian industry after two years and may propose
  amendments if industry can show it is hurt by the law.
      Norwegian imports from South Africa are limited mainly to
  high-grade manganese and coppernickle ores used in it
  ferro-alloys and light metals industries.
      Metals manufacturers estimate some 2,000 jobs could be
  affected by the boycott is suitable replacements for these ores
  are not found.
      The legislation now goes on to the upper house for formal
  ratification later this week, parliamentarians said.

"VENEZUELA OBTAINED 300 MILLION DLRS IN CREDITS
  venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln
  dlrs in financing for industrial projects and has also
  increased its lines of credit for import financing, finance
  minister manuel azpurua said.
      ""we can say that we are achieving the recuperation of
  credit, but that cannot be done overnight,"" azpurua said in a
  television interview.
      Azpurua said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be
  signed this week with the german state bank kreditanstalt fur
  wiederaufbau (kfw), to finance an expansion of the state
  aluminum company venalum.
      The credit will be divided into two separate agreements,
  one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and
  another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct. Azpurua said financing
  had also been obtained for the expansion of alcasa, another
  state aluminum company, as well as for projects in the state
  steel and petrochemical industries. He did not provide details.
      Yesterday, after a meeting of leaders of the ruling accion
  democratica party, azpurua said venezuela had obtained two new
  credits of five mln dlrs each for export financing, one from
  credit du nord of france and the other from the midland bank of
  great britain.
      The finance minister's statements came as the government is
  under sharp criticism for failing to obtain new credits,
  despite its insistence on repaying the foreign debt according
  to the terms of a rescheduling accord reached last february.
      Azpurua and other senior economic officals returned from a

"DOLLAR OPENS AT TOKYO RECORD LOW OF 143.75 YEN
  The dollar opened at a record Tokyo low

  dealers said.
      The previous record low was 144.70 yen set on March 30. The
  opening compares with 143.90/144.00 yen at the close in New
  York.
      The central bank bought dollars through Tokyo brokers just
  before and after the market opening, the dealers said.
      The intervention took place when the dollar fell to 143.20
  yen, one dealer said.
      The dollar opened at 1.8155/60 marks against 1.8187/97 in

      The dollar fell as low as 142.90 yen despite central bank
  intervention at 143.00 yen, dealers said.
      Selling pressure was strong from securities houses and
  institutional investors in hectic and nervous trading on
  underlying bearish sentiment for the dollar, they said.
      Most dealers were surpised by the dollar's sharp fall
  against the yen in New York, although many had expected such a
  drop to happen eventually.
      Institutional investors are expected to sell the dollar
  aggressively if it rises to around 143.50 yen, dealers said.

"U.S. ASKS CONGRESS TO REVISE TARIFF CATEGORIES
  The Administration asked Congress to
  replace the U.S. tariff schedule with a new system to bring it
  into line with international tariff categories, U.S. Trade
  Representative Clayton Yeutter said.
      The new system will add such items as fiber optics and more
  accurately define new composites, items not widely traded when
  the current schedule was devised some 30 years ago.
      Yeutter said the Harmonized System, as the new schedule is
  called, will change tariff categories and definitions to meet
  the present-day needs of exporters and importers, but they
  should pay about the same rates of duties.
      Yeutter said, ""American exporters will find it far easier to
  deal with one standardized worldwide system than the variety of
  differing systems which they now face.""
      He said the new system ended 12 years of multinational
  negotiations to create the unified tariff schedule.
      Yeutter said government and business moves are based on
  data from tariff schedules and the new system will improve
  knowledge of trade flows and the quality of decision-making.
      He said 56 nations pledged to bring their standards under
  the new system, with about half expected to join the system by
  January 1988.

"ABNORMAL RADIATION FOUND IN SOVIET TEA/HAZELNUTS
  Abnormally high levels of radiation were
  found in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months after
  the Chernobyl nuclear accident, West German residents in Moscow
  were advised this week.
      In a letter to the West German community here, Ambassador
  Joerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought in
  Moscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and
  -137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts.
      Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University,
  including honey, fruit, vegetables, pork, milk and butter, were
  found to be free of radiation, it said.
      Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts contained
  caesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by the
  United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
      The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no
  particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the
  tea leaves, but it warned against eating the hazelnuts.
      The products sent for testing were bought in state shops
  and private farmers' markets in Moscow, it added. Other Western
  embassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratory
  testing of Soviet food late last year because no abnormal
  radiation levels were detected.
      ""We didn't find anything so we stopped doing it,"" a U.S.
  Embassy spokesman said.
      A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipment
  remained in the embassy waiting room for British residents in
  Moscow who wanted to check their food, but laboratory tests had
  not been conducted for several months.
      ""Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as a
  precautionary measure, but we stopped in the absence of any
  alarming signals,"" he said. ""If the tests had shown abnormal
  readings, they would have been resumed.""

"AUSTRALIA ATTACKS U.S. GATT FARM RULES EXEMPTION
  Australia accused the U.S. of increasing
  protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to
  Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules
  on agricultural trade.
      Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a
  special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.
      ""Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing
  U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by
  actions which in fact increased protection in trade in
  agriculture,"" the Australian delegation said in a statement.
      ""The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic
  flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture,"" Arnott told the
  meeting.
      Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a
  justification for ""dubious protective measures"" by the U.S. He
  listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to
  close the U.S. sugar market to imports.
      He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to
  impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic
  support programs. This covered imports of dairy products,
  peanuts, cotton and sugar.
      Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the
  GATT, told Reuters: ""These charges have been made since the very
  beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural
  policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT"".
      ""We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the
  Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with
  their programs. We can negotiate them all,"" Samuels added.
      Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay
  round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.
  Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking,
  tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as

  A leading Soviet economist said the

      ""According to the information of state monitoring organs,

  cent of the volume of production,"" Alexei Sergeyev told the

"BRAZIL COFFEE EXPORTS DISRUPTED BY STRIKE
  An 11-day-old strike by
  Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead
  to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said.
      They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed
  but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by
  Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been
  disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike.
      A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant
  Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two
  weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source
  added.
      By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags
  behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped
  during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped,
  the sources said.
      Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags
  a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and
  not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee
  will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.

  Iran has test-fired its newly acquired
  Silkworm anti-shipping missile in the Strait of Hormuz and has
  set up at least two land-based launching sites in the area, a
  British naval source in the Gulf said.
      The source, who declined to be identified, said Iran had
  fired the Chinese-made missile at a hulk off its southern Gulf
  naval port of Bandar Abbas and scored a hit.
      ""These missiles pack a fairly big punch,"" he told Reuters.
  ""There is no doubt they could be used to target (shipping)
  across the Strait of Hormuz.""
      Tension in the Gulf has risen since U.S. Officials last
  week broke the news that Iran had acquired the Silkworm
  missiles.
      The U.S. Has said it will not allow Iran to use the
  missiles to choke off oil shipments and has offered its
  warships to escort Kuwaiti tankers past the missile batteries.
      But Tehran denied last Sunday it intended to threaten Gulf
  shipping and warned the U.S. Any interference in the region
  would meet a strong response.
      The British naval source said the Silkworms were in place
  at at least two sites around the Strait of Hormuz, but would
  not give the exact location.

"ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION
  Drilling for oil in California is
  likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels
  despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts
  said.
      Because much of the crude oil in California fields is
  thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to
  increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery
  is seen in drilling, they said.
      ""Companies will probably only drill their best prospects,""
  said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.
      Few new wells now are being drilled.
      Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available,
  were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared
  to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil
  Information Services, which tracks California drilling
  activity.
      ""It's in the dregs right now,"" said Bolster of the state's
  drilling activity.
      Current prices are not enough to justify increased
  drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent
  Producers Association.
      While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact
  to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices
  eventually fell.
      Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have
  slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high
  of about 17 dlrs.
      More than half of California's oil comes from stripper
  wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that
  much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to
  extract, Malmgreen said.
      ""It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs,""
  Malmgreen said.
      Many stripper wells along the southern California coast
  produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland
  wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur
  extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.
      The outlook for future production in California is clouded
  by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.
      In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which
  produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory
  drilling has slowed to a crawl.
      Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in
  1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of
  the state energy commission. So far this year only five
  exploratory wells have been drilled.
      ""I don't think they'll even get to what they did last
  year,"" Mitchell said.
      No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of
  the decade, Mitchell said.
      Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the
  number of producing wells and overall production.
      Between February and October of 1986, the number of
  producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from
  more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy
  Commission.
      In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output
  fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is
  expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.
      Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil
  production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels
  per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.
      Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986
  was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405
  mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of
  Conservation.
      ""Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels,""
  Guerard said.

"TOSHIBA, SHARP RESTRAIN LAP-TOP PC EXPORTS TO EC
  Toshiba Corp &lt;TSBA.T> and Sharp Corp
  &lt;SHRP.T> decided to maintain exports of lap-top personal
  computers to the European Community (EC) at last year's levels,
  despite the halt of shipments to the U.S., Company spokesmen

      They said the voluntary restraints were aimed at averting
  EC sanctions urged by European computer makers. The Europeans
  feared Japanese personal computers would flood EC markets after
  Washington imposed 100 pct tariffs last April.
      Toshiba and Sharp together control about 40 pct of the
  personal computer market in the EC, the Sharp spokesman said.
      Toshiba said exports of T1100 and T3100 lap-top computers
  would continue at 5,000 units a month for the time being.
      Sharp said exports to the EC of PC 7000 series lap-top
  personal computers would continue at last year's level of
  12,000 to 16,000 units a year.
      Washington imposed the tariffs because of Japan's alleged

"HUTCHISON SEES HIGHER PAYOUT, SATISFACTORY PROFITS
  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK>
  expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher
  dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
      He did not make any specific projections for the company's
  earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of
  not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed
  four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.
      It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,
  equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share
  split.
      Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to
  property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax
  profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
      The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln
  dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South
  China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,
  compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it
  expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the
  remaining shares.
      Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while
  its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely
  export-led growth.
      Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year
  against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.
      But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.
  May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect
  the British colony.
      He said all of the company's major operations showed
  improved results in 1986.
      Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct
  interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to
  &lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from
  Hongkong Electric.
      Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong
  Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related
  activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local
  stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one
  share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.
      Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares
  from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.
      The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will
  give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.
      Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve
  Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for
  making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from
  the government for the spin-off.
      He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets
  and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.
  Its major assets are the Hong Kong Hilton Hotel, property
  development, and interests in Husky Oil Ltd &lt;HYO.TO> of Canada

"IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND
  Growth in oil consumption in the Western
  industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct
  this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International
  Energy Agency (IEA) said.
      Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around
  one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in
  its Monthly Oil Market Report.
      Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from
  transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are
  higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be
  below last year's 3.6 pct, it said.
      The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices
  stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can
  be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some
  of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there
  may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.
      IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at
  428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption.
  This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.
      The agency said this flat trend is explained by the
  projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of
  the year which offset a reduction in stocks.
      It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell
  by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the
  year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but
  a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.
      It is possible that final data will show a larger draw,
  particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell,
  there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported
  stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.
      Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes
  on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built
  up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the
  period.
      The year-on-year trend of government stock building is
  continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more
  or less in line with consumption, after declining for five
  years, the IEA noted.
      Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6
  mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January
  1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption,
  respectively.
      Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April
  1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to
  94 days of consumption.
      World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln
  bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.
      This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude
  production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5
  mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from
  centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.
      Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first
  quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd
  of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average
  for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled
  28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.
      A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast
  3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the
  largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA
  said.
      Saudi Arabia""s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.

"BP&lt;BP> OFFER RAISES EXPECTATIONS FOR OIL VALUES
  British Petroleum Plc's plan to pay
  7.4 billion dlrs for less than half of Standard Oil Co has
  signalled higher values in the U.S. oil patch, analysts said.
      ""I think that BP's bid is a very strong affirmation and
  clear signal that they have confidence in the U.S., and they
  think the barrel of oil in the ground is going to go higher,""
  said Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
      BP earlier today said its U.S. unit planned to tender at 70
  dlrs per share for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already
  own.
      ""It's a 7.4 billion dlr price that (shows) OPEC has won the
  war and oil prices are not going to crack,"" said Prescott, Ball
  and Turben analyst Bruce Lazier.
      ""Behind that is a huge implication for the rest of the
  energy issues out there in the stock market, particularly those
  that are acquisition targets,"" Lazier said.
      One of those mentioned by Lazier was USX Corp, an
  energy-steel concern which had been courted by investor Carl
  Icahn and drew the attention of Australian Robert Holmes a
  Court last year. Rumors continue to swirl around its stock.
      Margoshes said he does not foresee major U.S. oil firms
  falling into takeover situations for several years, with the
  exception of possibly Amerada Hess Corp &lt;AHC>. He said most of
  the majors found partners in the last round of matchmaking
  which ended two years ago, and others restructured to the point
  that they have become unattractive.
      U.S. oil stocks rallied in response to the offer. Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON> rose 1-1/8 to 88-1/2. Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> jumped
  1-1/8 to 58-7/8, and Texaco &lt;TX> climbed 1/4 to 37-3/4. Unocal
  Corp &lt;UCL> rose 1-3/4, while Occidental Petroleum Corp &lt;OXY>
  climbed 1-1/8 to 34-3/4. Amoco Corp &lt;AN> rose 1-3/8 to 83-3/4.
      Standard Oil's stock was up 6-1/4 in heavy trading to
  71-1/8. Earlier in the session it had been at a high of 72-1/4.
  Wall Street has speculated British Petroleum may boost its
  offer by several dlrs per share, but the company maintained it
  would not raise the 70 dlr bid.
      British Petroleum stock rose 2-1/4 to 59-5/8.
      Analysts said the fact British Petroleum made such a bid in
  the first place indicates that the British oil giant has
  changed its outlook for the oil industry.
      Analysts said last year British Petroleum held one of the
  more bearish positions on oil prices.
      ""They said the real price of oil would stay at 15 dlrs (a
  barrel) for several years, and I think they beat a hasty
  retreat from that point of view,"" Margoshes said.
      ""They are more appropriately today looking more
  optimistically. I believe they are looking at 18 dlrs
  (long-term)...also in their heart of hearts they believe that
  will be exceeded,"" Margoshes said.
      The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate was
  trading today around 18.60 dlrs per barrel.
      Analysts said British Petroleum might have been able to buy
  up the rest of Standard Oil for about 50 dlrs per share when
  oil prices were falling last year.
      They said Standard Oil's brightest asset is its slightly
  more than 50 pct ownership of the Alaskan Prudhoe Bay oil
  field. Analysts also said the company has other interests in
  the Alaskan North Slope.
      Analysts said the Standard investment is extremely
  attractive to BP because the U.S. is the largest oil market and
  has hard-to-replace reserves.
      ""I think it just fits in with their long-range plans to
  increase their position in the U.S. market,"" Dean Witter
  analyst Eugene Nowak said.
      Analysts said it also raises BP's visibility ahead of the
  British government's announced disposal of 31.7 pct of BP
  stock. The U.K. government said it would dispose of the holding
  sometime in the year beginning April one.
      After acquiring all of Standard, most of BP's reserves
  would be in the U.S., but only about six pct of its stock is
  held in the U.S.
      ""The only way they can sell all that stock is to move it
  into the United States. No other market can handle all that
  stock,"" said L.F. rothschild analyst Rosario Ilacqua.
      In 1986, Standard Oil had net losses of 345 mln dlrs on
  revenues of 10.02 billion dlrs, compared to a profit the year
  earlier of 308 mln dlrs on revenues of 13.82 billion dlrs.

  Administration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file
  with the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval
  process to be a lengthy one.
      The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is
  currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated
  to condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been
  tested in a spermicide.
      Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand
  name, ""Carlton."" The exclusive distribution contract for the
  products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year
  periods, the company said.
      It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have
  not gone on sale in other European countries.
      It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the
  resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement
  or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from
  the FDA.
      The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to
  acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little
  or no assets. In the event an acquisition goes through, Solar
  Systems' interest in Europharmaceutical would be diluted below
  its current 45 pct.

"SPAIN RAISES BANKS' RESERVE REQUIREMENT
  The Bank of Spain said it raised the
  reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of
  deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened
  money supply and inflation targets.
      In a statement issued late last night, the central bank
  said the measure would take effect from March 13.
      ""In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the
  Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the
  monetary and inflation targets set by the government,"" the
  statement said.
      Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200
  billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve
  requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.
      The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the
  Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands
  at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the
  rate unchanged.
      Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based
  liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of
  8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of
  1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.
      Banking sources said that although the January money supply
  figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct
  in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared
  to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.
      Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that
  prices were under control.
      Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez
  Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for
  February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from
  six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during
  1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

"JC PENNEY &lt;JCP> UP ON SMITH BARNEY OPINION
  J.C. Penney Co's stock rose sharply 
  after analyst William Smith of Smith Barney recommended the
  stock, based on the company's strong earnings momentum and the
  possibility of a stock buyback, dividend hike or stock split,
  traders said.
      ""I am very impressed with the strong basic earnings story,""
  analyst Smith said, noting that the company has ""fine tuned its
  buying and inventories, and has admirably controlled costs in a
  time that they needed to.""
      The stock jumped 2-1/2 to 98-3/4.
      Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash
  position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the
  year before. ""This implies the possibility of a share buyback,
  or significant dividend increase or a stock split,"" he said.
      In addition, he said the company has been gradually
  adjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have been
  improving.
      Smith expects the company to earn 8.25-to-8.50 dlrs a share

  Last year's results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback of

      Sosnoff said the talks with Pratt and Southmark are not

  continued in the future.  He said there could be no assurance
  that a joint venture would be formed or that Caesars would
  agreed to talks.  ""Several preliminary contacts with
  representatives of Caesars have not resulted in any indication
  that it wishes to enter into such negotiations,"" Sosnoff said.
      He said based on talks with staff members of gaming

      Sosnoff said it has extended the tender until May 15.  The

"NEW RUBBER PACT TO BE FORMALLY ADOPTED TOMORROW
  A new International Natural Rubber
  Agreement (INRA) will be formally adopted tomorrow, chairman of
  the negotiating conference Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said.
      ""The successful negotiation of the new agreement represents
  a significant step forward in international economic
  cooperation,"" he told a news conference. The new INRA is to
  replace the current one which expires in October.
      Delegates at the renegotiation conference, held under the
  auspices of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development
  (UNCTAD), reached agreement over the central elements of a new
  accord last weekend.
      Xuto said the new INRA retains the reference price -- of
  201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kilo -- and indicative
  prices set in the present pact.
      Price levels will continue to be expressed in the joint
  Malaysian/Singapore currency, he added.
      The new agreement also maintains the basic structure of
  price ranges -- the ""may sell"" and ""may buy"" points at plus and
  minus 15 pct of the reference price, as well as the ""must sell""
  and ""must buy"" zones at plus and minus 20 pct of it.
      Xuto said the new pact maintains the same objectives that
  were set in the present accord. ""The most important of these are
  to stabilise prices and to achieve a balanced growth between
  demand and supply,"" he said. The buffer stock remains the sole
  instrument of market intervention for price stabilisation and
  its maximum capacity is unchanged at 550,000 tonnes, Xuto
  added.
      At this month's session, which was the fourth attempt in
  two years to negotiate a new INRA, the main issue to be
  resolved concerned the mechanism for adjusting the reference
  price.
      It was agreed to conduct reviews of the reference price
  every 15 months -- instead of the current 18-month intervals.
      The extent of the adjustment was also modified.
      Under the present agreement if the daily market indicator
  price has been above the upper intervention (""may sell"") price
  (currently 231 Malaysian/Singapore cents) or below the lower
  intervention price (""may buy"") price (171 cents at present) for
  six months, the reference price is then revised by five pct or
  whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council
  decides.
      Under the new pact, the adjustment under these
  circumstances will be five pct unless the Council decides on a
  higher adjustment.
      Similarly, when buffer stock purchases or sales amount to
  300,000 tonnes, there would be an automatic adjustment of three
  pct under the new accord unless the Council decides on a higher
  percentage.
      Throughout the talks, which began on March 9, producers had
  strongly opposed a consumer proposal to lower the reference
  price and the ""lower indicative price"" (or floor price) of 150
  cents in the present pact if the buffer stock, currently
  360,000 tonnes, reached 450,000 tonnes.
      The proposal, initiated by the U.S., was withdrawn last
  Friday, setting the stage for compromise at the weekend.
      Since then negotiators have worked on the finer details of
  the new pact.
      On the question of conditions for entry into force of the
  new INRA, Xuto said it was tentatively agreed that governments
  accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world
  imports approved or ratified the new agreement before it became
  operational.
      The present agreement had a figure of 80 pct.

"BRAZIL WANTS TO INCREASE STEEL EXPORTS TO U.S.
  Brazil wants to increase its
  steel exports to the United States, now limited because of
  tough import restraints set in 1984 by the Reagan
  administration, a spokeswoman for the Brazilian Steel Institute
  (IBS) said.
      Brazilian and U.S. Trade officials held the first of a
  three-day meeting today in Brasilia to discuss the issue.
      In 1984, after three months of painstaking negotiations,
  the U.S. Government reached accords with seven steel-exporting
  nations - Australia, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, South Africa
  and South Korea - to reduce their shipments to the United
  States by about 30 pct in 1985.
      The 1984 restraints established that for 1987 Brazil's
  steel exports to the U.S. Could not exceed 632,000 tonnes,
  increasing to 640,000 tonnes in 1988 and 670,000 tonnes in
  1989, the last of the five-year deadline set by the agreements.
      Brazilian officials are trying to increase Brazil's export
  share of non-flat products to the U.S. Market.
      The spokeswoman said there were reports of domestic supply
  problems in the United States.

"FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY
  The Bank of France is likely to cut its
  money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the
  start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call
  money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance
  Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.
      The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of
  the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five
  industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored
  considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks
  of turbulence.
      The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February
  23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily
  down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3,
  where it has now stabilised.
      Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb
  liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.
      While call money has dropped by well over a percentage
  point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has
  remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight
  pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.
      The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at
  8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.
      The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase
  rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while
  using the intervention rate to set the floor.
      Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said
  that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers
  said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come
  when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday,
  although an earlier cut could not be excluded.
     A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early
  as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.
      They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an
  acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging
  the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also
  pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving
  scope for a small fall in rates.
      M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished
  1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target,
  rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.

"U.S. MEAT INDUSTRY LAUNCHES CAMPAIGN IN JAPAN
  The U.S. meat industry has launched an
  aggressive promotion campaign in Japan to increase consumer
  awareness of U.S. beef and persuade the Japanese government to
  relax current beef import quotas.
      U.S. beef sales to Japan, currently around 480 mln dlrs
  annually, could increase to over two billion dlrs and as high
  as six billion dlrs by the year 2000 if Japanese quotas were
  removed and the Japanese consumer were made more aware of the
  attributes of U.S. beef, officials of the U.S. Meat Export
  Federation said at a press conference today.
      Partially funded with a 6.5 mln dlr award made through the
  Agriculture Department's Targeted Export Assistance (TEA)
  program, a five-year meat promotion campaign in Japan was
  launched by the U.S. Meat Export Federation in April.
      ""The promising Japanese beef market could be one of the
  bright spots for U.S. agricultural exports,"" said Philip Seng,
  Asian Director for the Federation. ""We supply and they (Japan)
  buy a very high quality of beef. They like our beef and want to
  buy more,"" he said.
      Seng pointed to Japan's beef quota system, which limits
  total Japanese beef imports to 177,000 tonnes per year and U.S.
  imports to 58,400 tonnes, as the major constraint in expanding
  U.S. beef shipments to Japan.
      The quotas were implemented in 1977 at a time of heavy
  Japanese foreign beef imports. The current quota agreement
  expires next March and beef quota negotiations are set to get
  underway this fall.
      The Reagan administration has called for an end to the
  quotas by April, 1988, but Japanese officials have said they
  would not liberalize imports regardless of the U.S. pressure.
      Officials from the Meat Export Federation told Reuters that
  they do not expect a complete lifting of the quota, but that
  they hope for at least a gradual increase in the quota.
      High beef prices in Japan caused by the protected market
  has also kept beef consumption at modest levels, meat industry
  officials said.
      Japanese shoppers pay an average of 27.14 dlrs for a U.S.
  tenderloin steak in a restaurant and an average of 47.42 dlrs
  for a Japanese-produced restaurant steak, the meat association
  said. At the retail level, U.S. striploin sells for 9.77 dlrs
  per pound, while Japanese beef sells for 28.51 dlrs per lb.
      Japanese consumers currently eat less than 10 lbs of beef
  per year, compared to 78 lbs for the average American,
  officials said.
      Total beef consumption in Japan is now 700,000 to 800,000
  tonnes per year, but Seng said with the removal of quotas and a
  decrease in beef prices, consumption could increase to 3.2 mln
  tonnes.

"USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE
  The U.S. Agriculture Department
  increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26
  mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.
      In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said
  the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the
  U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and
  coarse grain from other major suppliers.
      USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one
  mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the
  preliminary 1985/86 figure.
      Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln
  tonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with
  a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a
  cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.
      USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly
  from the previous January's level, while milk production
  increased by nearly six pct.
      Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in
  roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock
  production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier,
  USDA said.

"BRAZIL STRIKES CAUSE GOVERNMENT MAJOR PROBLEMS
  Strikes by Brazil's 40,000
  seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing
  major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt
  crisis.
      A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25
  years and union leaders say they have seriously affected
  Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.
      On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest
  payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp
  deterioration in its trade balance.
      Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most
  petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial
  heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for
  higher fuel prices.
      There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages
  could lead to a serious fuel shortage.
      The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the
  72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.
      The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today
  entitled ""Dangerous Confrontation,"" said: ""From the economic
  point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost,
  with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the
  country's external trade.""
      The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected
  offers of up to 100 pct.
      Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due
  to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior
  official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao
  Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless
  of the tribunal's ruling.
      Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse
  over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price
  freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not
  only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station
  owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao
  Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.
      Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of
  Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for
  exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.
      Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their
  profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six
  U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).
      Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last
  night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still
  could.
      Political sources said the government of President Jose
  Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel
  supply situation.

"DUTCH SUGAR TRADE DENY INVOLVEMENT IN OFFER
  Dutch sugar traders deny involvement
  in a plan to offer more than 850,000 tonnes of sugar to
  intervention in protest at EC export policy and prices, traders
  told Reuters.
      Although some 2,500 tonnes of sugar have been offered to
  intervention in the Netherlands, Dutch producers and traders
  said this sugar was actually Belgian and was being offered by
  the Belgian industry.
      ""We sympathise with the actions of the French, West German
  and Belgian traders and producers, but we are not party to it,""
  a spokesman said.
      EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned

  traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500. Dutch trade
  sources gave the same figure for France, but estimated up to
  110,000 tonnes offered by German traders and producers.
      The Dutch spokesman added, ""The weekly export tender policy
  and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry, and this
  is the only way in which they can really register their
  protest.
      ""These are desperate actions, but we believe that most of
  this offered sugar will be withdrawn within the three-week

"PHILIPPINE COCONUT CHIEF TO LOBBY AGAINST EC TAX
  Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA)
  chairman Jose Romero said he would visit Brussels later this
  month to lobby against a proposed 100 pct European Community
  (EC) levy on vegetable oil imports.
      ""I intend to visit Brussels and talk to whoever is putting
  up this devilish scheme to impoverish third world countries
  like the Philippines,"" Romero said in an interview.
      He said he did not know how much support the levy had
  within the EC but he said he believed those originally opposed
  to the tax were under pressure to change their position.
      Romero said a group of EC members led by West Germany, the
  Netherlands, Denmark and Norway were opposed to the tax. But
  there was a danger some of them would be persuaded to change
  sides, and if that happened opposition could crumble.
      Romero said another threat to exports lay in an EC warning
  that copra meal cake used in livestock feeds contained
  dangerous levels of aflatoxin, a carcinogenic chemical.
      He said the EC standard of 0.02 parts of aflatoxin per
  million parts of meal, which EC countries had been asked to
  apply by October 1988, was too rigid. He said Philippine copra
  cake contained much higher levels of aflatoxin.
      Aflatoxin comes from moulds which develop in copra when it
  is not properly dried or ground.
      Romero said he would tell big buyers of copra meal in
  London that the Philippines was doing its best to meet EC
  standards. It was also trying to eliminate aflatoxin totally,
  but this was likely to take several years of research.
      Copra meal exports were 817,641 tonnes or 35 pct of total
  coconut exports in 1986. The meal was worth 73.5 mln dlrs.
      Romero said he would also visit Oxford University's
  department of agricultural economics to discuss ways of
  avoiding the copra process altogether.
      ""There are ways of producing coconut products outside of
  copra,"" Romero said. ""We can process fresh coconut without drying
  the meat in the sun. Through the wet process we can process
  coconuts into other food or non-food products, or we can go to
  the chemical root.""
      He said there was a tendency for agricultural countries to
  become more protectionist and he expected export prices of
  coconut products to drop.
      ""In the long term we will be getting less and less for more
  and more production, and I'm not comfortable with that,"" he
  said.
      With countries like Indonesia and Malaysia stepping up
  production of palm oil, a coconut oil substitute, palm oil
  output had risen nearly 70 pct since 1971, Romero said.
      ""To add to that the U.S. Soybean Association is spending
  billions of dollars to discredit palm oil and coconut oil by
  saying that they are polysaturated fats and bad for the heart,""
  he said.
      Romero said he expected coconut product export prices to
  stay up for the rest of the year. They would probably touch a
  high of 20 cents/pound from the current level of 18.59 cents,
  and a sharp rise from year-ago levels of 10.50 cents.
      Romero said the Philippines was at the end of a five-year
  coconut production cycle which showed production tended to fall
  after two successive years of good harvests.
      He said 1985 and 1986 were good harvests and this year, to
  add to the production fall, drought had affected output.
      ""Traders are stocking up and when they have overbought the
  prices will start declining again. The only sure way to keep
  prices stable is by processing, adding more value,"" he said.
      Coconut farmers were being encouraged to intercrop by
  planting other cash crops between coconut trees, he said.
      ""A typical farm may have from 100 to 150 trees sitting on
  10,000 square metres of land. That's a lot of space,"" Romero
  said. He said the government's proposed land reform program
  would exclude about 75 pct of the coconut farmers because they
  had less than the proposed seven-hectares of land.
      ""If the idea of land reform is to increase income levels,
  production and employment then it won't happen,"" he said.
      PCA figures show about one-third of the country's
  population is dependent on the coconut industry.
      Coconuts are planted on about 3.2 mln hectares or
  one-fourth of total agricultural land.

"BONN SERIOUS ABOUT CURRENCY PACT, SAYS TIETMEYER
  West Germany takes ""very seriously"" the
  recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote
  exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry
  State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.
      Talking to journalists before a meeting of European
  Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer
  declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the
  Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements
  for stabilising currencies.
      But he noted the official communique said the participants
  agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange
  rates around current levels. ""We're taking this sentence very
  seriously,"" he said.
      Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against
  the mark since the meeting.
      He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been
  caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris
  agreement should help in this respect.
      Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the
  Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the
  economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and
  had not ruled out ""appropriate and timely"" action if necessary.
      Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion
  by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the
  economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.
      The Commission has sharply revised down expected German
  gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct
  predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC
  country to stimulate economic activity.
      Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed
  in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of
  1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in
  view that would make quick remedial action necessary.
      He said a number of favourable indicators such as high
  level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a
  recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up
  slightly during the course of the year.

"NIAGARA MOHAWK &lt;NMK> TO CUT COSTS
  Niagara Mohawk Corp said it is
  ""cautiously optimistic"" about results improvements for 1987 and
  said it is studying measures to cut operating costs.
      These measures include freezing management salaries,
  abolishing vacant positions and reducing overtime.
      A spokesman said the company had no current plans to lay
  off workers. The company declined to say how much the cost
  savings would amount to.
      A five year forecast is expected to be issued in early
  summer, a spokesperson said.
      The company said it has redeemed about 273 mln dlrs in high
  cost debt during 1986 and hopes to redeem more debt this year.
      For 1986, Niagara Mohawk's earnings per share fell to 2.71
  dlrs from 2.88 dlrs in 1985..
      The company said earnings reduced primarily as a result of
  a reduction early in 1986 in earnings return on equity allowed
  by the N.Y. State Public Service COmmission.
      Niagara said it is concerned about the continued lowering
  of authorized return and has reinforced petitions to grant a 
  fair return on equity.

"CHINA TRADE DEFICIT FALLS SHARPLY, RESERVES RISE
  China's trade deficit in the first
  quarter fell to 1.05 billion dlrs from 3.04 billion in the same
  1986 period, customs figures show.
      Zhang Zhongji, spokesman of the State Statistical Bureau,
  quoted the figures as showing exports rose 27 pct to 7.28
  billion dlrs and imports fell 5.1 pct to 8.33 billion.
      He said if imports of gifts, foreign aid items and
  materials for joint ventures are excluded, the deficit was only
  350 mln dlrs, and the surplus on invisibles was 700 mln. As a
  result, foreign exchange reserves increased somewhat from their
  level at end-1986, he said, but gave no figure.
      Official figures show the reserves at 10.514 billion dlrs
  at end-1986, down from 11.9 billion at end-1985.
      Zhang said one reason for the rise in exports was improved
  incentives to export firms, which are being allowed to retain
  more foreign exchange from the goods they sell.
      He said first quarter exports to Hong Kong and Macao rose
  35.5 pct to 2.48 billion dlrs and imports rose 55.3 pct to 1.46
  billion. Exports to Japan fell 2.3 pct to 1.28 billion and

"GERMAN WAGE ROUND SAID TO LIMIT MONETARY OPTIONS
  The Bundesbank's options for West
  Germany monetary policy are limited for the foreseeable future
  by the delicate stage of wage negotiations between unions and
  employers, economists and money market dealers said.
      Call money fell in quite active trading today, dropping to
  3.40/50 pct from 3.55/65 pct yesterday, and below the 3.50 pct
  treasury bill rate as a difficult month-end approached.
      But dealers and economists said the Bundesbank was unlikely
  to encourage lower rates in the foreseeable future largely for
  fear of upsetting the current wage round.
      One money market dealer for a major foreign bank said, ""I
  don't think the Bundesbank wants rates to go up whatever
  happens. But it also does not want them to fall. Above all it
  wants to wait to see how the unions wage round goes.""
      In West Germany, unions and employers prepare the ground
  for triennial wage negotiations based on detailed assessments
  of growth and inflation, economists said.
      Ute Geipel, economist with Citibank AG, said if the
  Bundesbank became more accommodating in monetary policy,
  raising fears in some quarters of a return in inflation in the
  medium term, unions would be obliged to curtail wage demands.
      As a result the Bundesbank was concerned to make no move
  that would interfere in the negotiating process, Geipel said.
      In the current round, the country's most powerful union,
  the IG Metall representing metalworkers and engineers, is
  demanding a shortening of the working week to 35 hours from the
  present 38-1/2 and an accompanying five pct increase in wages.
      The engineering employers' association, Gesamtmetall, is
  offering to bring in a 38-hour-week from July 1, 1988, and give
  a two stage wage increase -- a 2.7 pct rise from April 1 this
  year and another 1.5 pct from July 1, 1988.
      The agreement forged by IG Metall -- Europe's largest
  union, with 2.5 mln members -- and the employers would set the
  benchmark for settlements in other industries such as the
  public sector, banks and federal post office. Negotiations
  began in December and unions are hopeful they may conclude by
  early April, ahead of the traditional holiday period in June.
      Though many economists said the unions' current warning
  strikes and rhetoric were part of the negotiating strategy and
  would not lead to a repeat of 1984's damaging seven-week
  strikes, others said unions would not compromise greatly on
  their positions and there could still be conflict.
      This could extend the length of time in which the
  Bundesbank would keep its activity low-key, economists said.
      The money market head said the unions' humiliation by the
  protracted financial problems of the Neue Heimat cooperative
  housing venture would contribute to union obstinacy.
      ""The unions haven't forgotten that and they will put this
  squarely onto the account in the negotiations,"" he said.
      In addition, the newly-elected chairman of the IG Metall
  union, Franz Steinkuehler, was more radical and determined than
  his predecessor Hans Meyer and may be set for a longer battle
  to achieve the best possible settlement for his membership.
      More than 16,000 engineering workers at 45 firms, mainly in
  south Germany, held warning strikes lasting up to two hours
  yesterday. Firms hit included Zahnradfabrik Passau GmbH and
  aerospace group Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GmbH.
      Today, 28,000 employees from 110 companies came out in
  warning strikes, a statement from IG Metall said.
      Money market dealers said that overnight call money rates
  would rise in the near future in any case and did not depend on
  a politically-inhibited Bundesbank.
      About eight billion marks were coming into the market
  tomorrow from salary payments by the federal government.
      As a result, some banks fell back on the Bundesbank's offer
  to mop up liquidity via the sale of three-day treasury bills,
  anticipating still lower rates before the month-end.
      But a pension payment date by banks on behalf of customers
  was due on Monday, other dealers noted. If banks were short of
  liquidity until the bills matured on Tuesday, rates could soar,
  perhaps to the 5.50 pct Lombard ceiling.
      Banks were well stocked up with funds, having an average
  52.1 billion marks in Bundesbank minimum reserves in the first
  24 days of March, well above the 50.7 billion requirement.

"CHINA TRYING TO INCREASE COTTON OUTPUT, PAPER SAYS
  China's 1987 cotton output must rise
  above the 1986 level of 3.54 mln tonnes or supply will fall
  short of increasing demand, the China Daily said.
      Demand in 1986 rose 10.9 pct over 1985.
      Output in 1986 fell from 4.15 mln tonnes in 1985 and a
  record 6.2 mln in 1984, official figures show. The China Daily
  attributed the decline to several factors, including less
  favorable weather conditions and new state measures to restrict
  cotton production after the 1984 build-up of stocks.
      According to Customs figures, cotton exports rose to
  558,089 tonnes in calendar 1986 from 347,026 in 1985.
      To increase output quickly, the state will raise by 10 pct
  the price it pays for cotton produced above and beyond quota
  levels, the newspaper said. Its official purchasing agencies
  will buy cotton produced in excess of that originally
  contracted for, it added.
      The China Daily said all cotton growing areas in south

  acquiring more gold ore reserves in addition to the company's
  exploration efforts, chief executive Harry Conger told Reuters
  in an interview.
      ""We are looking at more options to acquire more reserves
  rather than just exploration,"" Conger said adding, ""the move to
  consider acquisitions represents a change in the company's
  acquisitions policy.""
      Conger said all of Homestake's current cash position of 120
  mln dlrs would be available to acquire reserves. In addition,
  Homestake has two lines of credit totaling 150 mln dlrs which
  have not been drawn on today and could be used to finance an
  acquisition, he said.
      Conger said he anticipates 1987 exploration budget will be
  about the same as 1986 spending of 27.3 mln dlrs. Conger said
  exploration for precious metals may be slightly higher than
  last year's spending of 17.7 mln dlrs while oil and gas
  exploration spending will be slightly less than last year's 9.6
  pct.
      Conger said he sees Homestake's 1987 gold production about
  the same as 1986 gold production of 669,594 ounces.
      However, 1987 first quarter production from its McLaughlin
  reserve will be about 10 pct lower than last year's 45,400
  ounces due to start-up production problems.
      He said he believes gold prices will hold above the 400
  U.S. dlr an ounce level for the rest of 1987.
       IN 1986, company earnings were based an average market
  price for gold of 368 dlrs an ounce.
      Conger said a three pct change in gold prices represents a
  12 cts a share impact on earnings but he declined to give a
  specific forecast for 1987's first quarter, due to be released
  in 10 days, or for full year 1987 results.

"USX &lt;X> PROVED OIL, GAS RESERVES FALL IN 1986
  USX Corp said proved reserves of oil
  and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the
  end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985.
      The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report,
  indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7
  mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last
  June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations.
      USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp,
  had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil
  and gas operations.
      About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit
  and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield
  services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate.
      According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell
  slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign
  reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large
  drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa,
  where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln,
  reflecting the exclusion of Libya.
      Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet
  at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985.
      Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and
  Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic
  feet, excluding Libyan reserves.
      U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet
  from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion
  from 1.53 trillion.
      In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962
  mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986
  audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited
  figure the company reported on Jan 27.
      USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs
  in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment
  tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the
  other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.
      In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were
  shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be
  permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03
  billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge
  included the ""indefinite idling"" last month of four plants in
  Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.
      Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana,
  Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.
      ""These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved
  market conditions for the products from these plants may make
  it feasible to reopen some of them,"" USX said in the report.
      ""On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement
  may necessitate their permanent closing,"" it added.

  USX Corp's USS division said it was

  One, 1987.
      The company said the increase reflects current market

      The company could not say what percentage the increase
  reflects from current prices, nor could it say how much per ton

  First Bank Systems Inc, in reporting
  higher first quarter net, said that if interest is not paid on
  the 140 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans and nine mln dlrs in
  Ecuadorian loans for the rest of 1987, its profits for the
  entire year will be cut by 6.9 mln dlrs.
      The banking firm said the non-performing status of these
  loans cut first quarter net by 1.7 mln dlrs.
      Earlier it reported first quarter profits of 57.4 mln dlrs
  or 95 cts a share, up from 46.6 mln dlrs or 80 cts a share in
  the year-ago period.
      Nonaccrual loans, restructured loans and other real estate
  were 637 mln dlrs, or 2.24 pct of total assets, compared to 514
  mln dlrs or 1.84 pct of assets at the end of 1986 and 636.1
  mln, or 2.46 pct of assets at March 31, 1986.
      The provision for loan losses in the quarter was 35 mln
  dlrs, compared to 152.1 mln in the first quarter 1986, when
  there was a special addition to the reserve of 100 mln dlrs.
  Net charge offs were 34.7 mln, compared to 41.1 mln dlrs a year
  earlier.

"HAWKER SIDDELEY CANADA TO SELL UNIT
  &lt;Hawker Siddeley Canada Inc> said that,
  due to poor market conditions for railway freight car
  manufacturing, it plans to sell its Trenton Works division in
  Trenton, Nova Scotia.
      Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln
  dlrs for the proposed sale.
      It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower
  earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel
  castings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector
  and improvements in forestry equipment.
      Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment
  was limited with export sales frequently restrained by
  customers' financing difficulties.
      Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways
  continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at
  the lowest level in the past decade.
      However, there was demand for industrial casting due to
  increased hydro-electric power generation, the company said.
      The company said manufacturing of mining machinery and
  tunnelling equipment showed greatly improved results in the
  U.S. and export markets, mainly China and India.
      The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in
  aircraft engine repair and overhaul and in the manufacture of

      Sawmill equipment and skidder operations were affected by a

"PARIS MEET AGREED NOT TO PUBLISH BANDS - LAWSON
  U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
  Lawson said the meeting of six major industrial nations in
  Paris last month agreed not to publish any bands in connection
  with their pact to stabilise currencies.
      Questioned by a parliamentary select committee about why
  the participating countries had not announced any bands, Lawson
  replied, ""we all agreed it would be much more sensible not to.""
  When asked whether that meant an informal joint currency float
  with set ranges was arranged in Paris, Lawson said ""I do not
  want to reveal the precise nature of the agreement, so as not
  to make it easy for"" speculation against the accord.
      Lawson said the Paris accord presumed that individual
  countries would take corrective action if their currency began
  reacting significantly to domestic macroeconomic factors.
      But if such movements were due to extraneous factors,
  Lawson said the other pact countries would come to its aid
  through concerted intervention on the foreign exchanges.
      ""It is clear that both Germany and Japan are having
  difficulty adjusting to their very large exchange rate
  appreciations and making their economies more domestically
  oriented, just as it is taking time for the United States to
  make its own economy more export oriented,"" Lawson said.
      In his oral evidence to Parliament's Select Treasury
  Committee, Lawson repeated that he was happy with the pound's
  current level, adding that ""It is an objective ... To try to
  keep it around that level.""
      He said the perception of sterling on foreign exchanges had
  changed since the steep drop in oil prices, largely because the
  pound had weathered that period so successfully. ""There has been
  a reassessment of sterling's fundamentals,"" Lawson said.  He
  disagreed with what he termed ""the grossly exaggerated claim""
  that real U.K. Interest rates were much higher than those of
  other major industrialsed countries.
      Using as a reference the key three-month sterling interbank
  rate as quoted in London, Lawson said Britain now had a real
  interest rate level of 5.75 pct - the same as Japan did and
  only a 0.75 percentaage point above the Group of Five average.
      Lawson confirmed that ""over the medium and longer term, the
  government's objective is zero inflation.""
      He said the government's intention of its PSBR constant at
  1.0 pct of GDP ""is the modern equivalent of the balanced budget
  doctrine.""  He added that ""to allow the debt/GDP ratio to remain
  constant on anything other than zero inflation basis is simply
  a recipe for accelerating inflation.""

"FINNS AND CANADIANS TO STUDY MTBE PRODUCTION PLANT
  Finland's national oil company Neste Oy
  &lt;NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms
  to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,
  Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.
      The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln
  Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether
  (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.
      The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada
  Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line
  Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.
      The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials
  availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the
  important capital and operating advantages gained by locating
  on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.
      The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant
  producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer
  that can replace tetra ethyl lead.
      Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States
  where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of
  health concerns, the statement added.
      Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the
  U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in
  Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,
  it said.
      Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five
  billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a
  major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.
      The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on
  stream in late 1989, the statement said.

"U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS
  The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal
  Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to
  measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not
  show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.
      The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options
  involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals
  agreed in January between the two central banks to make
  commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar
  standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.
      It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks
  have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.
      The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.
      ""On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate
  capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other
  hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital
  requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And
  U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively.""
       At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the
  so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a
  currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its
  potential change in value due to currency or interest rate
  fluctuations until the contract matures.
      In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance
  sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of
  five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the
  quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the
  contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the
  plans showed.
      The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would
  not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.
      They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk
  weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S.
  And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national
  government agencies, the proposals showed.
      The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot
  foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and
  options exchanges.
      It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England
  were keen to encourage banks to ""net"" contracts -- consolidate
  multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single
  agreement to create one single payments stream.
      It recognised that ""such arrangements may in certain
  circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their
  further development and implementation,"" and said some of the
  current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

"LINDNER SAYS HE DISCUSSED CONTROL OF TAFT &lt;TFB>
  Financier Carl Lindner, who holds a
  16.2 pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, told the Securities and
  Exchange Commission he has discussed with the company the
  possibility of seeking control of it.
      Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controls
  American Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Taft's
  managers and directors have been aimed at ""achieving an
  increased ownership position"" in the company.
      Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made either
  by making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part in
  a group to acquire the company.
      Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through American
  Financial and its subsidiaries, said he is also considering
  buying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals.
      He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led to
  any agreements or understandings.
      But Lindner said he intends to review his investment in
  Taft and may be involved in further talks or take other steps
  regarding the future control and direction of Taft.
      Lindner's investor group recently raised its Taft stake to
  1,489,298 shares, or 16.2 pct from 1,439,498 shares, or 15.6
  pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs.
      Although he recently received clearance from the Federal
  Trade Commission to raise his stake in the company to 24.9 pct,
  Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that his
  interest in Taft was for investment only and not was not
  seeking to control the company.
      An investor group headed by members of the wealthy Bass
  family of Fort Worth, Texas, also holds about 24.9 pct of
  Taft's common stock.

"EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE
  European currency markets reacted quietly
  to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers
  ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to
  surprise that the markets should have expected so much.
      The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies
  and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which
  reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency
  stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.
      Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining
  broadly entrenched in its current trading range.
      ""The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84
  marks,"" said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank
  AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.
      However, she said the dollar could break out of the range
  with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S.
  Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.
      Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd
  in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against
  the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen,
  possibly to 140 yen.
      A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects
  a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.
      London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb
  underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative
  sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank
  operators to test the downside.
      Concern that finance ministers and officials still in
  Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of
  currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with
  worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the
  near term, the traders said.
      Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the
  communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's
  downward trend.
      Traders in several centres said the market would look for
  fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to
  defend current ranges, which the communique said were ""broadly
  consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy
  intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.""
      Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said
  ""They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon."" The
  U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.
      However, some dealers said London-based operators would be
  unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long
  Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825
  marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.
      Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said
  the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable
  market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme
  volatility seen in the first few months of this year.
      One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the
  communique made clear the leading nations did not want a
  further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.
      The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to
  1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre
  accord's supposed currency target range.
      A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were
  ready for a period of ""mainly sideways movement.""
      But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique
  contributing to greater stability.
      ""Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big
  boost,"" said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he
  expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks
  in the next three months.
      A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said
  the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and
  should not have produced disappointment.
      ""The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade
  policies to redress current imbalances are of a different
  timescale than currency markets operate on,"" the source told
  Reuters, ""This is a political process which takes time.""
      Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in
  Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on
  currency markets today. ""Did people really expect a patent
  remedy?"" he asked.
      Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only
  the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully
  in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.
      A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was
  now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by
  Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could
  lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.
      Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in
  pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months
  while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to
  support the Paris accord.

"WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE
  Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back
  a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
  secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the
  companies at the core of their business empire.
      A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
  Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
  over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
  pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
      Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which
  Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
  price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
      Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
  424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
  rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
  the free shares.
      The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
  49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
  while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
  and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
      The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
  amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
      The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
  mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
  expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
  to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
      The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
  and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
  &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
  &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.
      Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
  shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and
  Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
      Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
  managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
  company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>.
      During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
  building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
  any raid on the heart of their business empire.
      But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
  electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small
  at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
  speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
  interests to protect its core activities.

"REAGAN TO ANNOUNCE DECISION ON JAPAN SANCTIONS
  President Reagan today is to
  announce a decision on tough new tariffs on Japanese exports to
  retaliate for what he calls Japan's failure to end its unfair
  practices in semiconductor trade.
      The 100 pct tariffs are to be imposed on 300 mln dlrs of
  Japanese goods recommended for curbs by a special panel of
  experts headed by the U.S. Trade Representative's Office.
      Reagan announced last March 27 he would impose the tariffs
  on certain goods taken from a list that ranged from computors
  and television sets to power tools and photographic film.
      The panel this week winnowed through the list of the some
  20 products and sent their recommendations yesterday to Santa
  Barbara, where Reagan is vacationing.
      In his March annoucement, Reagan said ""I am committed to
  full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide
  American industry with free and fair trade opportunities.""
      He added the tariffs would be lifted once Japan honored the
  pact it signed last year to end dumping semiconductors in world
  markets and opened its home market to U.S. products.
      U.S. officials said Japan had done nothing since the March
  announcement to alter Reagan's plan to invoke the sanctions.
      White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday:  ""we
  do not want a trade war, but we feel that this is the kind of
  action that requires meaningful action.""
      Reagan's move follows steadily rising U.S. trade deicits,
  with last year's hitting a record $169.8 billion.
      About one-third of the deficit is in trade with Japan.
      Congress is weighing a trade bill to force the president to
  retaliate in certain cases of unfair trade practices.
      He has opposed the legislation, saying it would prevent
  negotiated solutions to trade disputes and, in any case, that
  existing law was adqeuate to end unfair trade practices.
      Trade experts say his tough action against the Japanese was
  as much to penalize the Japanese as to show Congress he did not
  need any new trade legislation.
      The Japanese have complained that they have been honoring
  the semiconductor pact, but that it would take time before the
  results showed up.
      U.S. officials, however, have said their monitoring of
  Japanese semiconductor shipments to East Asian countries and
  Western Europe showed no letup in the dumping and that the
  Japanese home markets remained shut to American exports.
      Japan has said that if Reagan imposed the tariffs, it would
  file a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariff and Trade
  (GATT).
      It said hoped GATT would find the U.S. retaliation had
  violated the regulations of the global trading group and would
  approve compensation or Japanese retaliation.
      U.S. officials have said they did not think Japan would
  retaliate because it had too much to lose in any trade war with
  the United States.

"CHICAGO FUTURES LEADER SAYS MARKETS CAN ADAPT
  Foreign currency futures
  markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries
  agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band,
  said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile
  Exchange's, CME, executive committee.
      ""The target zone would not affect our market I think at
  all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy
  market,"" Melamed told Reuters in an interview.
      ""We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a
  four pct shift,"" he said, referring to permitted currency
  fluctuations in the early 1970s. ""One thing you can adjust is to
  make each contract a larger value.""
      As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental
  in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial
  to the Chicago exchange.
      Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can
  approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by
  governments to control currency fluctuations.
      ""They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an
  hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it's
  unrealistic and it doesn't work and it's unnecessary.""
      The CME's top policymaker also said a decision by the
  exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock
  index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would
  help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity
  markets on so-called ""triple-witching"" day.
      ""We think that the settlement in the morning will have a
  salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think
  this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change
  in the structure as of next June,"" when the move is scheduled to
  go into effect, he said.
      Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders
  of the popular Standard and Poor's 500 stock index future would
  address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.
      Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring
  brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own
  account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in
  dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to
  the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.
      The changes ""will in time have an extremely positive effect
  on the marketplace. That's going to prove very, very
  instrumental in increasing volume over time,"" he said,
  predicting the increase would come within a year.
      Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said
  the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit
  on the S and P 500 index's daily price movement when the
  Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could
  not be a temporary program.
      The CME also received ""many negative comments, many more
  than we anticipated,"" Melamed conceded. Many futures commission
  merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event
  the price approached the bottom limit.

"NICKEL PRICES UNLIKELY TO RISE MUCH - SHEARSON
  Nickel prices are unlikely to rise
  significantly from current levels unless further steps are
  taken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said in
  its quarterly nickel market report.
      The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb
  yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January,
  due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but
  Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year's
  buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.
      Output reductions by producers will take effect later this
  year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.
      Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in
  balance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at
  556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in

"S.KOREA SAYS JAPAN COMPLAINS TO GATT ON TRADE PLAN
  Japan has complained to the secretariat
  of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that South
  Korea's five-year plan to cut its trade deficit with Japan
  breaks GATT rules, Trade Ministry officials here said.
      They said Japan submitted a report earlier this month
  alleging South Korea's plan to import less from Japan and more
  from the U.S. And elsewhere was tantamount to creating
  non-tariff trade barriers.
      South Korea unveiled the plan in November. It said it hoped
  to narrow its trade deficit with Japan to two billion dlrs by
  1991.
      South Korea's trade deficit with Japan was a record 5.45
  billion dlrs in 1986, and rose to 752 mln dlrs in the first two
  months of 1987 from 727 mln in the same 1986 period.
      The plan envisages giving incentives to importers not to
  import Japanese goods, and to exporters to sell more to Japan.
      The officials said they believed the Japanese action, one
  step short of filing a suit, was designed to bring South Korea
  to the negotiating table and stop the plan.
      The Seoul government wants Tokyo to ease various import
  restrictions and simplify customs inspections for South Korean

"PAKISTAN SAYS GOOD ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES
  Pakistan says its economy has continued
  its recent outstanding performance during the financial year
  1986/87 ending on June 30 but areas like balance of payments,
  investments and energy were causing concern.
      GDP grew in line with the average growth rate since 1980
  and the inflation rate was the lowest since 1969/70, according
  to a government economic survey.
       The reform of economic regulation had gathered momentum
  and there was an impressive performance in a five point
  government program for rural uplift, education and poverty
  alleviation, said the survey.
      Ministry Economic Adviser Qazi Alimullah told a news
  conference that before recent unseasonal rains and hailstorms
  damaged the wheat crop, GDP growth was calculated at 7.04 pct
  compared to 7.25 pct in 1985/86.He said the figure might now
  slide down a little to around 6.8 or 6.9 pct.
      The survey said monetary expansion was estimated to be nine

      Alimullah said exports rose 18 pct to 3.5 billion dlrs from
  2.9 billion dlrs in 1985/86. But the at the same time, home
  remittances by Pakistanis abroad dropped to 2.3 billion dlrs
  from the 1985/86 level of 2.595 billion.
      More exports and an improvement in the balance of payments
  situation will be required to overcome this declining trend in
  home remittances, he said.
      The survey said the trade deficit was expected to fall to
  2.4 billion dlrs from three billion dlrs in 1985/86 because of
  the boost in exports.
      He said national investment continued to be small because
  of a poor rate of savings, about 14 pct of GDP. He said more
  savings were required to maintain or possibly step up the
  present growth rate and to finance the country's seventh
  five-year development plan to be launched in July 1988.

"MOST JAPAN FIRMS NOT RENEWING IRAN TERM CONTRACTS
  Most Japanese companies have decided not
  to renew term contracts to lift Iranian crude oil because spot
  prices remain considerably lower than OPEC's official levels,
  industry sources said.
      They said a cargo of the Mideast benchmark crude Dubai
  traded yesterday at 16.50 dlrs a barrel, compared to its
  official price of 17.42 dlrs.
      Only one Japanese company has renewed its term contract for
  Iranian crude oil for the second quarter, the sources said.
      The sources said Japanese companies had been lifting a
  total of about 185,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude
  under term contracts, but only one firm has agreed to lift in
  the second quarter. It is lifting just 10,000 to 15,000 bpd.
      They said this move could inspire Iran to offer discounts
  on cargoes loading in April, but the likelihood of discounts
  depended largely on the levels of spot prices.
      ""If the spot price of Dubai goes above 17.30 dlrs we would
  probably buy Iranian crude at the official price,"" one Japanese
  refiner said.
      ""We don't intend to put pressure on them,"" he added.
      Buyers have little incentive to renew contracts to lift oil
  at official OPEC prices while spot prices on all grades are
  considerably lower, oil traders said.
      They said if spot prices move higher there will be no
  problem finding OPEC crude to purchase at the official prices.
  Qatar has chartered floating storage for its crude oil after
  finding no buyers at official prices in March. The problem is
  likely to recur in April, adding to that country's surplus.
      The traders added that Iraq had dissociated itself from
  OPEC's December production agreement, while agreeing to the
  fixed prices.
      But oil analysts said if OPEC keeps group output close to
  its first-half 1987 ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd, supply and demand
  would be balanced by the end of the second quarter.
      They also said if OPEC holds its official price structure
  based on a reference price of 18 dlrs, spot price fluctuations
  should be limited to a 16.50 to 17.20 dlrs range for Dubai and
  a 17 to 18 dlrs range for the North Sea's Brent blend.
      One Japanese refiner said, ""At the moment there's a lot of
  pressure on OPEC, particularly on Qatar. But if they hold out
  there will be no problem, and I'm beginning to trust their
  ability.""
      Nigerian oil minister and OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman
  told a news conference in Lagos yesterday, ""Nigeria and all
  member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the
  December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas
  and official selling prices.""
      He said OPEC believed consumers had drawn heavily on stocks
  of both crude oil and refined products, reducing them to levels
  well below this time last year. He said consumers would soon
  return to the market in search of crude.
      A Japanese refiner said, ""The European and U.S. Markets are
  beginning to look better so OPEC might be quite lucky.""

"RUGBY WELL PREPARED FOR NEW CEMENT COMPETITION
  Rugby Portland Cement Plc &lt;RBYL.L> said
  it was well placed to operate in the new circumstances
  following the ending in February of the 53-year old cement
  manufacturers common price and marketing arrangements.
      In a statement following the release of its 1986 results,
  IT stated that the current year had started well. It reported
  that pretax profits in the year rose to 35.46 mln stg from
  21.84 mln previously on turnover higher at 313.3 mln after
  252.2 mln.
      The strong recovery of the first six months continued into
  the second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only
  modestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher
  volumes.
      The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the
  pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition
  due to growing imports and the possibility that the system
  would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K.
  Government. It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from
  strong organic growth, although overseas its Cockburn operation
  had a difficult period with high maintenance costs and
  increased depreciation charges.
      The company is proposing to change its name at the next
  annual meeting to &lt;Rugby Group Plc>.
      Rugby said it spent 27 mln stg on acquisitions in 1986. It
  noted that its Western Australia hotels company had agreed to
  sell the Parmelia hotel for 31.5 mln Australian dlrs, some
  seven mln stg above end-1986 book value.

"S. AFRICAN RESERVE BANK SAYS GROWTH RATE ON TARGET
  South Africa recorded annualised
  real growth in GDP of 3.25 pct in the first quarter of this
  year and the economy should achieve the government's target of
  three pct growth for 1987, the Reserve Bank said.
      The South African central bank said in its quarterly
  bulletin that confidence in the economy improved from January
  to May 31 because of the higher gold price, a rise in the
  nation's gold and foreign currency reserves and an improvement
  in the rand's exchange rate to just under 50 U.S. Cents.
      It noted the growth rate had slowed from 4.5 pct in the
  third and fourth quarters of last year.
      It also cited a three year debt recheduling agreement
  reached with international creditors in March as evidence of
  improved foreign perceptions of the South African economy.
      The accord effectively extends a moratorium on most
  repayments of 13 billion dlrs of South Africa's short term
  foreign debt. Total foreign debt is 23 billion dlrs.
      South Africa recorded a seasonally adjusted annualised

"U.S. URGES JAPAN TO OPEN FARM MARKET FURTHER
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng
  has asked Japan to open its farm market further to help
  Washington cut its trade deficit and ease protectionist
  pressures, an Agriculture Ministry official told reporters.
      Hideo Maki, Director General of the ministry's Economic
  Affairs Bureau, quoted Lyng as telling Agriculture Minister
  Mutsuki Kato that the removal of import restrictions would help
  Japan as well as the United States.
      The meeting with Kato opened a 12-day visit to Japan by
  Lyng, who is here to dicuss farm trade.
      However, Maki quoted Kato as replying that Japan was
  already the world's largest grain importer.
      Kato added Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Grain and
  depended on domestic output for only 53 pct of its food
  requirements in 1985.
      Lyng said the U.S. Put high priority on talks on 12 farm
  products named in U.S. Complaints against Japan to the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) last year, as well as on
  beef, citrus products and rice.
      Kato said Japan will maintain its current level of
  self-sufficiency and will try not to produce surplus rice
  because potential production is higher than domestic demand.
      The world farm market suffers from surpluses because of
  rising production by exporting countries, he added.
      Lyng said the U.S. Has been trying to reduce farm product
  output with expensive programs, Maki said.
      Maki said the U.S. And Japan will hold detailed discussions
  on each trade item as well as a new round of GATT trade talks

"ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK-EVEN IN 1987
  Schweizerische Aluminimum AG &lt;ALUZ.Z>
  (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing
  its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
      ""The threshold of profitability has returned to the
  foreseeable future,"" he said. ""We expect already in 1987
  approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that
  our industrial environment does not worsen.""
      He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past
  losses.
      Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986
  after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.
      Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and
  net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.
      Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for
  1985.
      But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news
  conference the new management installed a year ago had decided
  to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate
  rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an
  asset.
      Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an
  gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from
  472 mln in 1985.
      It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,
  after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary
  in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in
  1985.
      Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from
  1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and
  exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a
  50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.
      Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this ""radical
  elimination of the mortgages of the past"" painful, but said the
  foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.
      Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was
  strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56
  billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.
      Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111
  mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct
  in 1985.
      In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had
  arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of
  Switzerland &lt;SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z> and Credit
  Suisse &lt;CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a
  subordinated loan.
      The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not
  cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only
  to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a
  new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss
  banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.
      Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining
  bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.
      That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss
  instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169
  mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a
  479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.
      The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of
  1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar
  alternations were made for previous years.
      After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895
  mln francs.

"CONRAC &lt;CAX> EXPLORING RESTRUCTURING, BUYOUT
  Conrac Corp, whose board has
  rejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV Industries
  Inc &lt;IV>, said it is exploring alternatives such as a
  restructuring, leveraged buyout or takeover of the company.
       In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and
  legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV
  offer, which it said it considers inadequate.
      The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,
  leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another
  company, Conrac said.
      Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives at
  special meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision on
  whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on ""the
  future actions of Mark IV"" and its unsolicitied tender offer.
      Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored
  could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer, it said.
      Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the
  terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it
  becomes final, the company said.
      The board also took other defensive steps, including
  granting severance agreements to some officers, it said.
      At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted a
  provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all
  classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders
  meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to
  remove directors without cause, the company said.
      The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it
  planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a
  special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority
  of the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said.
      Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were given
  severance agreements, or ""golden parachutes,"" it said.
      Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would get
  a cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906
  dlrs last year, if there were a change of control in the
  company, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the
  company's voting stock, Conrac said.
      Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph
  O'Donnell, who made 143,325 dlrs last year, would get
  one-and-a-half times his salary if there were a change in
  control. Smorada's salary was not listed in the SEC filing.
      The executives would also get cash settlements of options
  plans and continuation of insurance and other benefits.

  West German Economics Minister Martin

      In a statement reacting to the five institutes' joint

  with exports falling by 0.5 pct. The other two saw only one pct
  growth and said exports would fall 2.5 pct.
      Bangemann said ""The government, agreeing with the majority,
  sees no reason for the extraordinarily pessimistic estimate for

      He said there was reason to believe that export demand
  would start to rise in the course of the year, partly because

"COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS
  Congress, eager to find budget
  savings, launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department's
  generic commodity certificate program tomorrow, amid signs USDA
  and the General Accounting Office, GAO, are at odds over how
  much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.
      The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that
  payment-in-kind, or PIK, certificates cost between five and 20
  pct more than cash outlays, administration officials who asked
  not to be identified said.
      USDA officials, however, took issue with the report, saying
  it did not take into account storage, handling and transport
  savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to
  re-examine the costs, sources said.
      The issue is an important one, because congressional budget
  committees are known to be considering limiting the use of
  certificates as a means of cutting spending.
      Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior
  Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the
  Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.
      Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are
  uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared
  to cash outlays, and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp,
  CCC, almost equal costs, department sources said.
      USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents
  to store, handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in
  government storage.
      It was unclear whether the GAO, Congress' investigative
  arm, would stick by its original analysis that it costs the
  government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm
  price and income support programs, Reagan administration
  sources said.
      The GAO is expected to point out that use of
  payment-in-kind, PIK, certificates has helped relieve tight
  storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been
  sold.
      The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director
  Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees
  intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal
  budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of
  PIK certificates.
      The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates, or
  certs, as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to
  farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to
  repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or
  cash.
      Between April and December 1986, CCC issued 3.8 billion
  dlrs worth of certificates, according to USDA. Up to another
  6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and
  August 1987, according to USDA.
      Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily
  because recipients can use the certificates to pay back
  government loans at levels below the loan rate.
      Eliminating this practice, called ""PIK and roll,"" would save
  the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92, according to
  the Congressional Budget Office, CBO. That estimate, according
  to a CBO official, was based on an assumption that certificates
  cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.
      The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be
  considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other
  savings alternatives.
      The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the
  estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date
  have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln
  dlrs, or between five and 20 pct, more than cash outlays, one
  administration official said.
      However, the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates
  based in part on USDA criticism, department officials said.
      The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable
  to the different effect certificates can have on market prices
  over the course of a crop year.
      USDA's Economic Research Service, for example, has found
  that between June and August last year, the 215 mln bushels of
  corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by
  between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.
      Between September and November, however, certificates had
  only a marginal impact on corn prices, according to the ERS
  study, obtained by Reuters.

"ARCO &lt;ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS
  Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a
  spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could
  gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts
  estimated.
      Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on
  rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on
  about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was
  valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.
      Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement
  around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of
  the unit, leading investors to take profits.
      After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,
  closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.
      ""It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat
  disappointing,"" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He
  said rumors of the spin-off had been around ""for a couple of
  days.""
      Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't
  getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its
  value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
      Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said
  the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and
  he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.
      Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says
  chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about
  three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500
  to 600 mln dlrs.
      Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake
  because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the
  company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.
      But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall
  through. Yesterday, ARCO said the proposal had not yet been
  presented to its board.
      The chemical unit last year had revenues of 1.9 billion
  dlrs.

"INTERNATIONAL SUGAR PACT TO BE RENEGOTIATED
  The International Sugar Agreement (ISA)
  will be renegotiated, International Sugar Organization (ISO)
  officer in charge Constantin Politoff told Reuters after a
  special session of the pact's council.
      A decision on how to renegotiate will be taken at the ISO
  six monthly session in May. The alternatives are between an
  autumn London conference for another pact without economic
  clauses, but a different voting and budgetary structure, or a
  Geneva-based conference next year for a new pact with economic
  clauses, he said.
      But delegates said the latter would only be considered if
  the world's four major exporters -- Australia, Brazil, Cuba and
  the European Community -- can resolve differences over how
  prices can best be supported and how to share the world
      Today's special session was called because the U.S. earlier
  indicated it would only be able to pay 56 pct of its share of
  the ISO budget.
      At today's council session Politoff said the U.S. would try
  and find a way to pay the balance of about 50,000 stg later
  this year. Currently, about three quarters of this year's ISO
  800,000 stg budget has not been paid but delegates said the
  U.S. caused controversy as it said it might not pay its full
  contribution in the last year of the current pact.
      The Soviet Union has called for changes to the way the ISO
  budget is shared out. Currently it is halved between importers
  and exporters and the Soviet Union has a 30 pct share of the
  importer half. The Soviets want a new sugar pact to have only a
  single category of members who would all share the costs pro
  rata to their share of world sugar trade.
      The ISO executive committee next meets on April 23 with the
  next full council session in the week of May 19.
      There are 12 importing and 44 exporting members of the ISO.

      The USDA probably will accept about 80 to 90 pct of the

      However, some analysts said a 10 to 12 mln acre sign-up may
  end up being negative to new crop corn prices, citing trade
  talk earlier this year that 14 to 15 mln acres may be submitted
  by farmers. Also, acres set-aside under the conservation
  program are by definition poor yielding, so the impact on total
  corn production will be minimal, they added.

"TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT RECORD HIGH
  Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves, bouyed

  about 42 billion at the same time last year and 68 billion on
  October 5. He declined to elaborate.
      A senior bank official, who declined to be named, told
  Reuters the reserves were likely to reach 72 billion dlrs at
  the end of the year.
      ""The surge in reserves is the result of our trade surplus
  and recent purchases of U.S. Dollars on the local interbank

  Indonesia has increased its share in a

      The Japanese Export-Import Bank said Indonesia had raised
  its share of (P.T. Indonesia Asahan Aluminium) company,
  capitalised in 1975 at 91 billion, by swapping 32 billion yen
  in government loans to the company for an equity stake.
      The Japanese shareholders, the Overseas Economic
  Cooperation Fund and 12 companies, are to invest another 24
  billion yen raising capitalisation to 147 billion yen.
      Asahan reported total losses of 97.6 billion rupiah between
  1982 and 1985. Suhud said much of the company's 320 billion yen
  debt had been caused by falling tin prices and the appreciation
  of the yen against the U.S. Dollar. Aluminium is sold in
  dollars.
      Prices improved from 1,150 dlrs a tonne six months ago to
  about 1,450 dlrs today. The plant is supposed to break even if

  the 1.5 pct rate it had forecast earlier this year.
      The institute, whose forecasts are more pessimistic than
  those of the other four leading German institutes, said the
  economy had passed its peak in the summer of 1986, and its
  prospects had dimmed significantly since the autumn.
      The DIW repeated earlier predictions that gross national
  product (GNP) in the first quarter of 1987 would contract in
  real, seasonally adjusted terms against the weak final quarter
  of last year.

"KLOECKNER UND CO'S 1986 PROFIT FALLS ABOUT 20 PCT
  Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, the
  international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net
  profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the
  profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.
      The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a
  domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.
      It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln
  mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover
  possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary
  because of recent declines in raw material prices.
      Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in
  prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.
      It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary
  share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held
  largely by family foundations.
      Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation
  certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield
  of around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a
  quarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the company
  added.

"YUGOSLAV ECONOMY WORSENED IN 1986, BANK DATA SHOWS
  National Bank economic data for 1986
  shows that Yugoslavia's trade deficit grew, the inflation rate
  rose, wages were sharply higher, the money supply expanded and
  the value of the dinar fell.
      The trade deficit for 1986 was 2.012 billion dlrs, 25.7 pct
  higher than in 1985. The trend continued in the first three
  months of this year as exports dropped by 17.8 pct, in hard
  currency terms, to 2.124 billion dlrs.
      Yugoslavia this year started quoting trade figures in
  dinars based on current exchange rates, instead of dollars
  based on a fixed exchange rate of 264.53 dinars per dollar.
      Yugoslavia's balance of payments surplus with the
  convertible currency area fell to 245 mln dlrs in 1986 from 344
  mln in 1985. The National Bank said the drop was due to a
  deterioration in trade. Exports to the convertible currency
  area rose 11.6 pct from 1985, while imports rose 17.8 pct.
      Retail prices rose an average of 88.1 pct in 1986 while
  industrial producer prices rose by 70.6 pct, the bank's data
  showed. The cost of living rose by 89.1 pct.
      Personal incomes rose by 109 pct in 1986.
      Prime Minister Branko Mikulic warned in February that wages
  were too high given the level of productivity.
      Mikulic introduced a law cutting wages to the level of the
  last quarter of 1986 and tying future rises to productivity.
      Bank statistics show the overall 1986 rise in M-1 money
  supply was 109.1 pct with a year-end position of 3,895.9
  billion dinars. Yugoslavs have 9.8 billion dlrs worth of
  foreign currency savings in the country and 20 billion dlrs
  abroad, mostly owned by workers employed in western Europe.
      The dinar fell by 73.1 pct against a basket of hard
  currencies in 1986. The highest depreciation was against the
  Swiss franc, 85.3 pct, and the lowest against the U.S. Dollar,
  46.2 pct.

"STERLING OUTLOOK CLOUDED BY TEST OF PARIS ACCORD
  The move by foreign exchange markets to
  test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into
  question the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one
  of the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.
      Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen
  sharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.
      While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and
  dollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to
  sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of
  relatively high U.K. Interest rates.
      But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first
  tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.
      The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar
  down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to
  intervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene
  effectively, the Paris accord could collapse.
      ""On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6
  collapses,"" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.
      He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their
  attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been
  restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.
      However, although most analysts and foreign exchange
  dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or
  even retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp
  drop in the U.K. Currency.
      Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K.
  Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and
  relatively high interest rates, they said.
      Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been
  running especially high after last week's budget, seen as
  popular both with the markets and with British voters.
      Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the
  West German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is
  trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.
      Recent opinion polls showing Britain's ruling conservative
  party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also
  supported the pound.
      In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two
  half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than
  two weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the
  next week or so, has already been largely discounted.
      U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still
  relatively high compared to other western countries, and
  analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely
  to affect sterling.
      Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar's decline,
  dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.
      Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange
  markets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond
  (gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.
      Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has
  been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.
      Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady
  for the next few days while the market awaits further
  developments on the dollar and this Thursday's U.K. Current
  account figures for February.
      Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg
  after January's small surplus.

"COFFEE PRICES BAD NEWS FOR LATIN AMERICA -MINISTER
  A senior Nicaraguan official said a
  recent plunge in coffee prices was economically and politically
  disastrous for Latin American coffee-producing countries.
      Nicaraguan Foreign Trade Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca
  was in London to brief International Coffee Organisation (ICO)
  executive board producer members after a meeting last weekend
  in Managua attended by eight Latin American coffee producers to
  discuss the fall in coffee prices.
      London coffee prices slid 300 stg per tonne in March, to
  1,279 stg from 1,580 stg at end-February.
      Martinez told reporters the price fall since the ICO failed
  to agree export quotas on March 1 has had disastrous results on
  Latin America, both economically and politically.
      He urged continued negotiations among coffee producers to
  pave the way for a coffee export quota agreement by September.
      Coffee export quotas, used to regulate coffee prices under
  an International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago
  when prices soared in response to a drought in Brazil.
      Central American economic ministers have estimated the
  region will lose 720 mln dlrs in foreign exchange earnings in
  1987 if coffee prices are not rescued by a quota arrangement,
  Martinez said.
      He said ICO quota talks broke down last month because
  consumer members lack the political will to fully support
  commodity agreements, and because consumers tried to dictate to
  producers.

"POLISH FARM PRICES AND COSTS TO RISE FROM JULY
  Polish farmers will receive price rises
  ranging from 13.4 pct for some crops to 23.3 pct for meat from
  July 1, the Finance and Agriculture ministries said.
      The state procurement price for rape will rise 13.4 pct to
  5,500 zloties per quintal, while wheat and rye will go up an
  average 18.2 pct to 3,100 and 2,400 zloties per quintal. Pork
  will rise by 18.8 pct and beef 23.3 pct.
      The ministries said the new prices aimed to ensure farmers'
  profits and meet higher living costs. But at the same time they
  said fertilisers would rise by an average 50 pct, animal feeds
  by 38 pct and tractors by 25 pct.

"BRAZILIAN SEAMEN SAY 14,000 NOW BACK AT WORK
  About 14,000 of Brazil's 40,000
  seamen are now back at work after pay accords with 21 shipping
  companies but the rest are still on strike, a spokesman at
  strike headquarters said today.
      The seamen began a national stoppage on February 27.
      The spokesman, talking by telephone from Rio de Janeiro,
  said 126 ships were strike-bound.
      He added that because of resignations by many seamen there
  were scarcely any crews left on 38 of these ships.
      The seamen have settled in general for pay rises of 120 pct
  with the 21 companies. Talks with the shipowners' association
  Syndarma have been deadlocked over overtime.
      While exports have been delayed by the strike, exporters
  say the problems have been manageable.
      ""It hasn't been critical by any means,"" said a coffee trader
  in Santos, who noted that coffee was still moving on foreign
  ships.
      Economic analysts added, however, that any delay to exports
  served to aggravate Brazil's balance of payments crisis, which
  last month prompted the government to suspend interest payments
  on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.

"U.S. TAKES TOUGH STAND ON GATT FARM ISSUES
  The United States is prepared to ""pull out
  all the stops"" to defend its agricultural trade rights under the
  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), U.S. Ambassador
  to GATT Michael Samuels said.
      Those rights are now being challenged by the European
  Community's (EC) agricultural support policies, he told a
  conference sponsored by the American Soybean Association.
      He reiterated Washington's firm intention to retaliate if
  the EC goes ahead and bans imports of hormone-fed beef without
  the issue being investigated by a GATT special committee.
      The U.S. claims the EC directive, due to come into effect
  on January 1, threatens to cut 100 mln dlrs worth of U.S. meat
  shipments into the EC.
      The U.S. also will oppose all EC efforts to impair U.S.
  trade via the EC oilseeds regime, which supports EC oilseed
  prices over the current market level and which may be extended
  to include a hotly disputed oils and fats tax, Samuels said.
      Reduction of trade-distorting world agricultural subsidies,
  an aim of most key participants in GATT multilateral trade
  negotiations, ""is meaningless if import barriers continue to be
  erected,"" Samuels said.
      Samuels called the U.S. plan to eliminate world farm
  subsidies by the year 2000, proposed at GATT in July, ""visionary""
  and ""very serious.""  The EC and Japan have said it is
  unrealistic.
      The EC Commission this month announced its draft proposal
  on farm trade reform, expected to be tabled at GATT formally
  next week.
      The EC scheme involves emergency measures to reduce
  tensions in troubled surplus sectors of cereals and cereals
  substitutes, dairy and sugar. It also calls for reduction of
  farm subsidies.
      The U.S. Is not opposed to short-term measures, as long as
  they are directly linked to long-term commitments to end major
  trade distortions, Samuels said.
      Washington will review the EC proposal when it is formally
  submitted and respond to it officially then.
      ""We will consider its relation to the Punta del Este
  declaration to correct trade problems and expand market access,""
  the U.S. Ambassador said.
      The U.S. can say no to the EC proposal if the EC ignores
  the U.S. plan when it tables its own proposal, he added.
      The key difference between the two approaches is that the
  U.S. wants farm subsidies eliminated, while the EC is pushing
  only for a reduction in farm suppports, Samuels said.
      If the EC farm budget were protected by a subsidy freeze,
  there would be little incentive for the Community to work to
  correct the international trade situation, he added.
      Samuels cited the animal hormones complaint, the EC
  oilseeds regime and an EC regulation concerning meat imports to
  third countries as three crucial barriers to trade which the
  U.S. wants to see resolved under the auspices of GATT.

"SWISS 1988 INFLATION SEEN AT TWO PCT - INSTITUTE
  Swiss inflation is likely to rise in 1987
  and 1988 because of inflationary tendencies in the domestic
  economy, the Centre for Economic Research of the Federal
  Institute of Technology said in its spring review.
      It forecast a rise in consumer prices of two pct in 1988
  compared with 1.3 pct in 1987. Low import prices in 1986 helped
  to keep annual inflation down to 0.8 pct.
      The centre said that in general the outlook for the Swiss
  economy in 1987 and 1988 remained favourable, despite the more
  difficult international economic climate facing export
  industry.
      The centre repeated its previous forecast that growth in
  Swiss domestic product would slow to 2.2 pct in 1987 from 2.5
  pct in 1986. It revised its forecast for 1988 GDP growth to 1.7
  pct from 1.6 pct in its last autumn review.
      Domestic demand will continue to replace exports as the
  motor of economic growth. Private consumption will grow by
  three pct in 1987 and two pct in 1988 against 3.75 pct in 1986.
      Growth in goods exports will slow to 1.75 pct in 1987 from
  2.1 pct in 1986 but pick up slightly to 2.5 pct in 1988. All
  three figures are well below the Swiss average for recent
  years. In 1985, for example, exports increased by 9.1 pct.
      The centre said the strength of the Swiss franc, which has
  firmed sharply in recent months, would continue to put pressure
  on Swiss exporters.
      It forecast that imports of goods would grow by a more
  modest 4.5 pct in 1987 and 3.25 pct in 1988 than in 1986, when
  import prices fell substantially and imports rose by 8.2 pct.
      Industrial production will grow by 1.6 pct in 1987 and 1.2
  pct in 1988 compared with 4.2 pct in 1986.

  China's summer grain harvest may be good

"S.AFRICA'S FINANCIAL RAND SEEN HEADED HIGHER
  The financial rand, widely viewed
  as a direct reflection of foreign investor confidence in South
  Africa, appears headed above 30 U.S. Cents, dealers and bank
  economists said.
      The currency has risen about 25 pct in the past three
  months to its current rate of 29.50 cents, due partly to signs
  of a possible power shift with the appearance of a number of
  independent candidates in the whites-only election on May 6,
  they added.
      It has risen about two cents this week alone.
      ""Another factor is that banks in London, where the main
  market is based, are going long in the currency because of a
  general feeling that it will rise in the future,"" one economist
  said.
      Dealers described 30 cents as a psychological barrier that
  was expected to be broken soon after a brief consolidation
  phase from recent gains.
      After reaching 30 cents, ""There is a chance of appreciation
  to 32 cents in the next several weeks,"" one dealer said.
      There was a widespread feeling that both the commercial
  rand, holding stable at 48 cents, and the financial rand were
  staying firm, banking sources said.
      A Barclays National Bank executive who asked not to be
  identified said: ""The rise of the independents appears to be
  indicative of a potential shift of power in the National Party
  and has created a favourable sentiment overseas.""
      One dealer said growing business and investor interest from
  West Germany and Switzerland were behind the financial rand's
  rise.
      Economists said foreigners also were being attracted by
  South Africa's long-term government bonds and ""semi-gilts"" or
  securities in partly government-owned firms, many with yields
  as high as 30 pct. They could be purchased with financial rands
  with interest paid in commercial rands.
      ""This has had a definite influence on the financial form of
  the rand,"" a dealer said, adding that at present demand is
  slightly in excess of supply.
      The financial rand was reintroduced in September 1985 to
  help end capital flight from South Africa during a period of
  severe political unrest in the country.

"UPTREND REMAINS INTACT FOR DEBT FUTURES
  The six basis point rise of the past
  month in U.S. debt futures may be extended next week by a
  series of U.S. economic reports, analysts said, as long as the
  dollar holds firm.
      ""Interest rates have declined by approximately 50 basis
  points over the last month, largely over indications that
  inflation is not as high as people had feared and the narrowing
  U.S. trade balance, in nominal terms,"" Samuel Kahan, chief
  financial economist with Kleinwort Benson Government
  Securities, said.
      Kahan said recent government reports have shown strength in
  the economy during the first quarter, but his concern is
  whether the U.S. economy will sustain that strength in the
  longer term.
      Weak U.S. economic growth could hurt the dollar, which has
  become more important to the direction of debt futures than the
  beneficial impact on interest rates of a sluggish economy.
      The median trade expectations for Tuesday's U.S. Consumer
  Price Index and Durable Goods reports are up 0.4 pct and down
  1.5 pct, respectively.
      Meanwhile, the eight billion dlr drop in the M-1 money
  supply announced this week was ""surprising, much larger than
  expected,"" according to Kahan. ""Unless quickly reversed,"" such
  a trend ""will ensure that June M-1 growth will be negative,""
  Kahan said.
      Taken in conjunction with M-2 and M-3 aggregates which
  Kahan said have ""slowed to a crawl, below Federal Reserve Board
  annual targets,"" the consequences could be a hint of economic
  weakness down the road, he said.
      Based on chart formations, T-bond futures may be poised for
  further gains, although the advance has been slowed recently,
  analysts said.
      September T-bonds ""are up almost six points since about May
  18,"" Merrill Lynch debt analyst Jim Duggan noted. September
  bond futures climbed from the low of 87 a month ago to over 93
  in mid-June, Duggan said.
      While follow-through buying has aided the advance so far,
  and bouts of short covering have prohibited a slide through
  chart support, the rally in September T-bonds has been thwarted
  above the 93 level.
      ""The 93 level is formidable resistance and must be taken
  out before this activity is anything other than a trading range
  market,"" Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures debt analyst
  Brian Singer said.
      The dollar remains the key fundamental factor, and the U.S.
  currency has made little headway of late, analysts said.
      ""The critical variable remaining in the market is the value
  of the dollar,"" Kahan said.
      Additional influences next week will be possible
  developments ahead of an OPEC members meeting, and the impact
  and size of the U.S. budget deficit, ""although these will not
  be in the forefront of the market early next week,"" Kahan said.
      In looking ahead to the U.S. Treasury mini-refunding
  auctions of 24.25 billion in T-notes on Tuesday, Wednesday and
  Thursday, Singer said the market will likely greet the results
  with little excitement. However, a successful auction could
  prove to be a turning point, depending on prevailing market
  psychology.

"BANK OF FINLAND TO TRADE IN BANKS' CERTIFICATES
  The Bank of Finland said it has
  started dealings in banks' certificates of deposits (CDs) with
  immediate effect and that it was prepared to issue its own
  paper to stimulate operations on the domestic money market.
      Bank of Finland Governor Rolf Kullberg told a news
  conference the Bank will also limit credits on the call money
  market from March 30, 1987, by introducing a maximum credit
  amount and a penalty rate if banks exceed this ceiling.
      ""The recent introduction of three-month money and these new
  regulations are decreasing the role of the call money market
  and the discount rate as monetary instruments,"" Kullberg said.
      Bankers welcomed the central bank measures saying these
  were needed to accelerate the domestic money market. The Bank
  of Finland had never before been allowed to issue its own CDs,
  they said.
      ""The central bank for the first time has an instrument with
  which it really can influence the price of money in this
  country,"" one banker said.
      Under the new rules banks are limited to call money credits
  to a maximum of 7.5 pct of the total of their equity capital
  and cash reserves. A penalty rate of interest of 19 pct is now
  introduced if the limit is exceeded.
      Director Sixten Korkman at the Bank of Finland's monetary
  department said he expected the bank to pursue an active policy
  on the interbank market as an issuer of own-CDs.
      ""We are free to do it, so maybe on Monday we will issue the
  first, just to see how the system functions. Overall I think we
  will issue at least a few times a week,"" Korkman told Reuters.
      He said the bank was likely to aim at CDs with a

"U.S. DOT APPROVES AMERICAN &lt;AMR>-ACI &lt;ACF> PACT
  The U.S. Department of
  Transportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the
  proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American
  Airlines Inc.
      ""The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen
  competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest,"" the
  DOT said in a statement.
      AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a
  unit of AMR Corp.
      The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan
  Feb. 20.
      American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of
  revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small
  carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the
  nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not
  alter American's third-place ranking, according to data
  compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.
      The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.
  market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.
      The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially
  reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers
  provide either nonstop or single-plane service.
      At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT
  said it found no evidence that other carriers could not
  increase or begin service that competed with a merged
  American-AirCal.
      Concerning the 14th, ""While entry may not be possible at the
  Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the
  service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,
  especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will
  provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in
  long-haul markets,"" the DOT said.
      The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the
  authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County
  terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal
  building limit future opportunities for expansion.
      The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments
  opposing the merger but ""raised no new facts or arguments.""
      Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will
  pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings.

"ABU DHABI MARKETING SAID NOT BREACHING OPEC PACT
  A senior Abu Dhabi oil official said
  in remarks published today the emirate, largest producer in the
  United Arab Emirates (UAE), was succeeding in marketing its
  crude oil without breaching OPEC accords.
      Khalaf al-Oteiba, Marketing Director at the Abu Dhabi
  National Oil Co (ADNOC), told the company's Petroleum Community
  magazine ADNOC was also keen to keep good customer relations.
  ""The company will maintain its dialogue with and care for its
  customers in accordance with market conditions...And take
  necessary steps to guarantee marketing its production,"" he said.
     ""The present oil marketing policy of ADNOC is based on
  adherence to OPEC decisions of December 1986 to control
  production and establish a new pricing system in an attempt to
  stabilize the market,"" he added.
      OPEC agreed last December to limit production to 15.8 mln
  bpd and return to fixed prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.
      Oteiba said stabilization of the oil market in the future
  depended on how much discipline OPEC showed.
      Oteiba said last year, when world oil prices dropped, was
  ADNOC's most difficult ever but ""a practical and flexible
  pricing policy was implemented to relate to the changed market
  environment.""
      He said crude oil sales last year jumped to an average
  609,000 bpd of which 73 pct was exported. Refined product sales
  totalled eight mln metric tonnes, of which 67 pct was exported.
      In 1985, ADNOC marketed a total of 476,000 bpd of crude oil
  and 7.2 mln tonnes of refined products.

"U.S. CHIPMAKERS URGE SANCTIONS AGAINST JAPAN
  The Semiconductor Industry
  Association urged the U.S. government to impose trade sanctions

      In a letter to Treasury Secretary James Baker the group
  said sanctions should be imposed against Japanese chipmakers as
  of April 1 and should continue until the United States is
  satisfied that there is full compliance with the agreement.
      The group said action by Japan to cut back on semiconductor
  exports is not what is required.

  that U.S. industries not bear the burden for the persistent

"U.S. MEAT PROCESSORS ASK FOR LABELLING CHANGE
  Four U.S. meat processors have asked
  the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which
  they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat,
  the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co,
  Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow
  mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as
  the species from which it was derived.
      For example, ""pork"" would be listed on the ingredients
  statement instead of ""mechanically separated pork.""
      Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product
  would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically
  separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat
  and poultry portion of the product.
      Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost
  product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.
      Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated
  ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry
  product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient
  statement as ""mechanically separated (species),"" USDA said.
      USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid
  using mechanically separated meat in their products because the
  term carries an ""unwarranted negative connotation"" in the minds
  of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar
  regulation exists for poultry products.
      Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass
  parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some
  remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.

"U.S. SAYS NO SIGNAL BEING SENT BY SHIP MOVEMENTS
  A U.S. Navy battle group led by the
  U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk is in the northern Arabian Sea
  amid renewed concern about the safety of shipping off the coast
  of Iran, U.S. officials said today.
      But Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffmann said that reports the
  naval strike force was in the region did not mean the United
  States was sending a new warning to Iran against escalating
  attacks on shipping in the Persian Gulf.
      ""Nothing like that has happened,"" he said. ""No signal is being
  sent.""
      He said that the Kitty Hawk is operating in an area where
  it usually does. ""It's normal. It's in the waters where it's
  supposed to be. It's been there for over a month.""
      The Kitty Hawk and its force of warplanes is the mainstay
  of the U.S. Indian Ocean Battle Group which patrols a vast area
  extending from the Indian subcontinent through the Arabian Sea.
      With the Kitty Hawk and its group in the Arabian Sea to the
  south and the U.S. Mideast Task Force in the Persian Gulf to
  the north, the United States has 10 warships on either end of
  the strategic Straits of Hormuz.
      The Pentagon, as is its custom, declined to confirm the
  exact whereabouts of the ships or what they were up to.
      State Department officials cited concern about the safety
  of ships passing through the Straits on the vital oil supply
  run to the Gulf.
      Iran has conducted repeated attacks on shipping in the Gulf
  and U.S. officials have said that Teheran has recently equipped
  itself with powerful Chinese and Italian-made anti-ship
  missiles, posing a greater threat.

"DISEASE PUTS ZIMBABWE BEEF EXPORTS IN JEOPARDY
  Zimbabwe's beef exports to the European
  Community (EC), potentially worth 70 mln Zimbabwean dlrs this
  year, may be jeopardised by an outbreak of foot and mouth
  disease in southwestern Matabeleland, industry sources said.
      The country has temporarily suspended beef exports to the
  EC because of the outbreak and awaits a decision from the EC
  veterinary committee, which is considering a formal ban.
      The outbreak in the country's main ranching province has
  already led neighbouring beef-producing Botswana and Zambia to
  bar beef and dairy imports from Zimbabwe, threatening the dairy
  industry with a loss of at least one mln dlrs in export
  revenue.
      ""The situation is still uncertain at the moment. Normally
  when an outbreak occurs there is an automatic suspension of
  beef exports,"" one industry source said yesterday.
       Commenting on EC policy, he explained, ""Depending on the
  seriousness of the outbreak the (veterinary) committee then
  decides on three options, allowing us to continue exporting
  beef from disease-free areas, clamping a three-month suspension
  on exports or banning us from exporting for a year. We are
  still awaiting their decision,"" he added, asking not to be
  identified.
      Zimbabwe was granted an export quota of 8,100 tonnes of
  high-grade beef to EC markets in 1985 after the country had
  spent millions of dollars erecting disease-control fences and
  upgrading abattoirs to meet stringent EC rules.
      Should the EC ban Zimbabwean exports, the country will be
  forced to sell its beef on glutted world beef markets at low
  prices, the source said. Projected earnings from beef sales
  could fall about 23 mln dlrs as a result, he said.

"YEUTTER SEES GATT CONSENSUS ON FARM TRADE REFORM
  U.S. Trade Representative
  Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached
  a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the
  latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
  Trade (GATT).
      Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but
  told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved
  in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to
  improve the global situation in agriculture.
      Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to
  discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched
  in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.
      Yeutter said ""at least people seem to be going down the same
  road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is
  another matter entirely.""
      There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with
  the problem quickly and ""a more common understanding of how we
  are going to get from here to there,"" Yeutter said.
      However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of
  years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.
      ""It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough
  immense amounts of financial resources into the production of
  items that nobody wants to buy,"" he said.
      He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the
  financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more
  productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its
  inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he
  said.
      Individual segments in many countries may lose in the
  process, but it should result in a more rational system of
  world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.
      It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a
  relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26
  billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more
  than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources,
  he said.
      Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in
  the negotiations, he said ""one has to be politically
  realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural
  trade reform) done in two to three years it's going to have to
  be as part of a larger package.""

"HIGHER SPENDING EXPECTED IN MALAYSIA'S 1988 BUDGET
  Malaysia's recovery from the worst
  recession in 20 years should receive a boost on Friday when the
  government announces a reflationary budget for calendar 1988
  after seven years of austerity, economists said.
      ""Our country is walking on one leg now,"" said Ismail Salleh,
  an economist with the Institute of Strategic and International
  Studies. ""It has to depend on public sector investment for
  faster growth if the private sector is not moving.""
      Gross domestic product grew one pct in 1986 after shrinking
  one pct in 1985. The fiscal year ends December 31.
      The government has said it expects 1987 growth to be under
  two pct but some analysts believe it will be nearer three pct
  because prices for commodity exports have risen sharply.
  Malaysia is a leading exporter of rubber, palm oil, tin and
  semiconductors and a major producer of cocoa, timber and oil.
      The government slashed development spending to 9.8 billion
  ringgit this year from 14.5 billion in 1986.
      Economists said unemployment is expected to exceed 10 pct
  in 1988 against about 9.5 pct this year.
      Local investment also has stagnated, with businessmen
  blaming inconsistent economic policies and lack of incentives.
      One businessman said too many politicians give the
  impression that Malaysia was unstable.
      ""If we can take care of investment confidence, the potential
  to recover strongly is great,"" a banker said.
      Malaysia's 1987 current account is expected to be in the
  black with the Central Bank projecting a 500 mln ringgit
  surplus compared with last year's 1.2 billion ringgit deficit.
      The government has said its fiscal policies will balance
  the budget by 1989. The deficit in 1986 was 952 mln ringgit.
      The government will also repay some of its external debt,
  which stood at 51 billion ringgit at the end of 1986.
      Political leaders have said the budget will not hurt
  ordinary people as taxes on basic food and other essential
  goods are unlikely to change.
      Businessmen said they hope the government also will cut the
  corporate tax, now between 45 and 48 pct, to enable Malaysia to
  compete for investors with neighbouring states.

"TAIWAN SAYS U.S. WANTS TAIWAN DOLLAR TO APPRECIATE
  The United States wants Taiwan's
  currency to appreciate faster to reduce Taiwan's trade surplus
  with the U.S., A senior trade official said.
      Board of Foreign Trade director Vincent Siew told reporters
  on Saturday U.S. Officials told him in Washington last week
  that unless Taiwan allowed its dollar to rise faster it would
  face retaliation.
      Siew returned from Washington on Friday after the U.S
  responded to Taiwan's request to increase its textile export
  quotas by promising further talks in May. Taiwan's surplus with
  the U.S. Hit a record 13.6 billion U.S. Dlrs in 1986.
      Washington signed a three-year accord with Taipei last year
  limiting textile export growth to 0.5 pct a year.
      Siew said the Taiwan dollar had risen by about 15 pct
  against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.
      It surged last week amid indications Washington was seeking
  a major rise in its value. It rose four cents against the U.S.
  Dollar on Saturday to close at 34.59.
      Western trade sources told Reuters Taiwan and the U.S. Have
  been holding talks on the currency issue but added it is not
  clear how far Washington wants to see the Taiwan dollar rise.

"SEARCH FOR BRITISH FERRY'S TOXIC CARGO CONTINUES
  The search continued for a
  cargo of poisonous chemical substances loaded on the Herald of
  Free Enterprise Ferry which capsized in Zeebrugge harbour
  Friday.
      A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were
  loaded on trucks in the ship's hold have been recovered, but
  Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a
  further 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution.
      A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the
  front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out.
      Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside the
  wreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now lies
  partly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour.
      The ferry's owner is &lt;European Ferries Plc>, majority owned
  by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>.
      The operation to right the vessel began yesterday after
  divers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said it
  could take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodies
  estimated to be trapped amid debris.
      ""The problem is that in these waters you can normally expect
  one working day out of four,"" said Daan Kaakebeen of Dutch
  Salvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam. He
  estimated the job itself would require 35 working days.
      Using reinforced cables, salvage experts intend to raise
  the ship and set it down into a trench dug alongside.
      Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss of
  the ferry, one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channel
  routes from England to continental Europe.
      Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry's main vehicle
  loading doors, set close to water level.
      In London, Transport Secretary John Moore told parliament
  yesterday that the ship keeled over after water gushed in
  through the bow doors. He said a major government inquiry into
  the disaster will be held, all similar ferries sailing from
  Britain will be inspected and owners will be asked to fit
  lights to give warning if bow doors are not properly closed.
      Experts carrying out tank and computer tests to determine
  how the accident occurred will focus attention on the ship's
  doors, its ballast system and crew procedures, he added.
      Two other investigations into the disaster have also begun,
  one Belgian and one by the ferry's owners.

"JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.
  Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
  U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
  tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
  a senior ministry official said.
      ""Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
  by other suppliers,"" the official, who declined to be named,
  said. ""Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
  its farm import market,"" he said.
      Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
  its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
  protect local farmers.
      Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
  End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
      Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
  share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
  beef accord next March 31.
      Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
  from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
      U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
  beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
  imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
      An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
  Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
  some one billion dlrs in new business.
      The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
  controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
  purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
      To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
      But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
  reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
  industrial sector.
      ""Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
  issues should not be discussed on the same table,"" the official
  said.

"JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT
  Japan's unemployment rate is expected to
  continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from
  January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu
  Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.
      December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the
  government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling
  statistics under its current system in 1953.
      ""There is a general fear that we will become a country with
  high unemployment,"" said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for
  the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
      The government, which published the January unemployment
  figures today, did not make any predictions.
      ""At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment
  rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation
  improving,"" a Labour Ministry official said.
      Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had
  expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000
  people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.
      Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference
  the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget
  which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.
      The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel
  and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries,
  such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees
  and ceased hiring, economists said.
      Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a
  great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down,
  said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank
  Ltd's economics department.
      However, other economists disagreed, saying the service
  sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the
  manufacturing sector over the next five years.

"UNOCAL&lt;UCL> SCRAPS FLUIDIZED BED BOILER PROJECT
  Unocal Corp said it told the U.S.
  Treasury Department that it will not include fluidized bed
  combustion technology, a method for the more efficient burning
  of solids, at its Parachute Creek oil shale project in Colorado
  due to high costs.
      Under a 1985 agreement with the now-defunct U.S. Synthetic
  Fuels Corp, Unocal said it would study using the technology at
  the oil shale plant. In return the company would have been
  eligible for 500 mln dlrs in loan gaurantees and price supports
  from the U.S. Treasury Department, which took over the contract
  from the Synthetic Fuels Corp, Unocal said.
      Unocal said its studies showed the cost for the fluidized
  bed combustion facility would have exceeded 352 mln dlrs,
  compared with an original estimate of 260 mln dlrs.
      The fluidized bed facility would have provided heat and
  electricity for the oil shale project, Unocal said.
      Last year's fall in oil prices and the loss of investment
  tax credit under the Tax Reform Act made the project
  uneconomical even with government price supports and loan
  guarantees, Unocal said.
      The Parachute Creek oil shale plant produces about 4,000 to
  5,000 barrels per day of crude shale oil, Unocal said.

      Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
  an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
  Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.
      The additional output would be related to plans now under

  might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.

"1ST CENTRAL FINANCIAL &lt;FCC> SEES HIGHER EARNINGS
  First Central Financial Corp said it
  expects earnings to rise significantly in 1987 and said it is
  actively seeking an acquisition.
      The property and casualty insurance company's chairman and
  chief executive officer, Martin J. Simon, told Reuters in an
  interview that he expects earnings of 33 cts a share in 1987
  compared with 25 cts a year ago.
      He said, ""the company currently has the sufficient momentum
  to achieve those earnings and the successful completion of
  licensing applications to operate in Pennsylvania, Delaware,
  Connecticut and Ohio should fuel our earnings.""
      The company is currently licenced to operate only in New
  York state.
      Simon estimated that the company would earn seven cts a
  share in the first quarter compared to three cts in the same
  quarter a year ago, and eight cts a share in the second quarter
  compared to five cts earned in 1986. He expects the company to
  earn nine cts a share for each of the final two quarters of
  1987.
      In addition, Simon said, First Central Financial ""is
  actively looking for, and has several acquisition brokers
  looking for a small life insurance company to acquire.""
      He said the acquisition should be in the 10 mln dlr range

  been targeted as yet, ""but I would like to make my first
  acquisition in 1987,"" he said.

"DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED
  Roughly half of this year's expected
  130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground,
  a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the
  Netherlands, told Reuters.
      Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date
  for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April
  23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman
  added.
      ""It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can
  expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the
  crop is off to a very good start,"" he said.
      Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600
  hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of
  white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined ""A""
  and ""B"" quota of 872,000 tonnes.
      This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been
  introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000
  hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000
  tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota ""C"" sugar produced.
      Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been
  allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being
  boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.

"YEUTTER SAYS JAPANESE CURB ALL BUT CERTAIN
  U.S. Trade Representative Clayton
  Yeutter said it was all but certain President Reagan would go
  ahead today and impose curbs on Japanese exports as planned.
      Asked in a television interview what the chance was for
  Reagan to cancel the scheduled 100 pct tariffs on Japanese
  electronic exports, he said ""slim to none.""
      Reagan announced on March 27 he would impose the tariffs to
  retaliate for Japan's failure to honor a 1986 agreement to end
  dumping computer semiconductors in world markets at less than
  cost and to open its home markets to U.S. products.
      Yeutter, on the NBC program ""Today,"" said the United States
  did not want to terminate the agreement and would drop
  the tariffs once Japan began fulfilling the agreement.
      He said Japanese negotiators last week told U.S. officials
  they were honoring the pact, but Yeutter said it would take
  time to monitor any compliance.
      Asked how long that would take, he said ""We want to see a
  pattern of compliance, so in a minimum I would say that would
  take a few weeks.""
      Yeutter said he did not think there would be much consumer
  impact by the tariffs on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese goods
  because the items selected are also readily available from
  other countries and manufacturers.
      He said he did not think Japan would retaliate.
      ""It seems to me it is not in the interests of either country
  to get in an escalating conflict.  The Japanese understand that
  full well,"" Yeutter said.
      He added Japan might challenge the tariffs in the General
  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), but ""that's more of a
  paper kind of exercise and I don't really expect to see any
  adverse impact on U.S. trade.""
      Yeutter also said he did not see any way the semiconductor
  issue could be resolved before or during a Washington visit
  later this month by Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone.
      He said he hoped the visit, which is to have trade as a
  major issue, would be productive but ""I don't see any practical
  way to resolve this particular dispute before or during his
  visit.""

  A supply shortage of number two oil in

  April heating oil ended 1.24 cts higher to 51.65 cts a gallon,
  while April crude settled 28 cts higher at 18.64 dlrs.
      ""The rally was led by spot month heating oil contract,

      April gasoline was 0.28 cent higher at 53.15 cts a gallon.

  report in the Middle East Economics Survey that said that OPEC

"EC WARNS CONGRESS ON NEW TRADE BILL
  The European Community (EC) has
  warned the U.S. House of Representatives that tough trade
  legislation it is considering could prompt retaliation by U.S.
  trading partners.
      The warning was sent in a letter from Sir Roy Denman, head
  of the EC delegation in Washington, to Dan Rostenkowski,
  chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
      A copy of the letter was made available to Reuters.
      Denman told Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, he backed
  aspects of the bill, such as one backing new talks under the
  GATT and one excluding protection for the textile industry.
      But Denman disagreed with other provisions which would
  require President Reagan to take retaliatory trade action
  against nations with large trade surpluses with the U.S. and
  would set new standards for judging unfair foreign trade
  practices.
      Denman told Rostenkowski that GATT regulations prohibit
  member nations from taking unilateral retaliatory action in
  trade disputes unless the action is GATT-approved.
      He said ""If the Congress makes retaliatory action mandatory,
  then the United States would be in violation of its
  international legal obligations and on a collision course with
  its major trading partners.""
      Denman added that a president should have flexibility in
  enforcing trade laws, saying ""in the last resort, any
  administration must take its decision in light of the overall
  national interest.""
      Otherwise, he said, ""the risk would be counter-reaction by
  trading partners of the United States, i.e., retaliation or
  enactment of mirror image legislation to be employed against
  imports from the United States.""
      Denman also said Congress could prompt retaliation if it
  reduced the threshhold of unfair trade by making it easier for
  firms to file unfair trade practice claims.
      Retaliation could also be prompted by relaxing standards
  for findings that imports were injuring U.S. firms.
      ""Changes in these standards must be agreed upon
  multilaterally. They cannot be imposed by the United States
  alone on the world trading system,"" he said.
      House leaders have rejected a plan by textile-state
  legislators to add to the trade bill a provision to curb
  imports of cloth and clothing, similar to a measure passed two
  years ago but vetoed by President Reagan.
      There was concern by the leaders that Reagan would veto the
  entire trade bill because of the textile amendment.

"ARAB BANKER SAYS TOO SOON FOR SINGLE CURRENCY
  Gulf Arab states must coordinate
  economic policies more closely before moving towards their goal
  of a unified currency system, the President of the Arab Bankers
  Association said.
      Hikmat Nashashibi told a news conference at the end of an
  Arab currency traders meeting: ""We have to start with
  coordination of fiscal policies as a prerequisite for a common
  system of currencies ... There is quite a substantial way to go
  yet.""
      He said only then would a unified Gulf currency system be a
  plausible project.
      The six nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council -- Saudi
  Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab
  Emirates --  have held a series of meetings this year to
  examine linking their currencies to a single peg in a system
  which bankers say could be modelled on the European Monetary
  System (EMS).
      At present, five currencies are linked either officially or
  in practice to the U.S. Dollar, while the Kuwaiti dinar is
  pegged to a trade-weighted basket of currencies.
      A common currency system or EMS-style ""grid"" would, in
  theory, foster regional trade by providing a basis for stable
  exchange rates, but Nashashibi said inter-Arab trade is at a
  very low ebb and capital flows between Gulf states remain
  small. ""Capital markets in the Arab world are still in their
  infancy,"" he said.
      Nashashibi said lack of experience among Arab banks, a
  paucity of financial instruments and a legal framework that
  often does not recognise the western banking concept of
  interest have hampered the growth of Arab markets.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND
  ""If we go on using up
  farmland as we have done since 1980, there will be none left in
  20 years to grow grain on.""
      Xu Jinfeng, a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on
  the edge of Shanghai, sums up the dilemma China faces as it
  tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same
  time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.
      China has to feed one quarter of the world's population,
  but only one seventh of its land is arable.
      Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into
  a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985, and again in
  1986.
      But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which
  has occurred at the same time, has gobbled up arable land for
  factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.
      Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of
  its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller
  amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during
  the two years.
      ""We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the
  industrialisation began,"" official Xu said. ""Since then, nearly
  all the families in the county have built new homes and many
  factories have gone up.""
      ""Last year we lost land to a new railway line,"" Xu said. But
  land losses in future should fall because nearly all families
  already have new houses, she added.
      The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the
  Peking leadership, which announced earlier this month that
  China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land
  for the first time this year.
      ""The present situation of abusing, occupying unlawfully,
  wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious,"" said
  an article in the official press explaining the new measures.
      ""It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland,"" it
  said. ""China has a large population and its land resources are
  badly deficient.""
      An official of the Shanghai city government said county
  authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of
  arable land to other uses, while anything more than that must
  be approved by the city government.
     The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its
  efforts to ensure China's people get enough grain to eat. The
  prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low, making
  it more profitable for them to grow other crops.
      To offset this, the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser
  and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to
  buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to
  China's 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise
  grain output, paying farmers bonuses to grow it.
      Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the
  problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.
      Chen Zuyuan, Communist Party secretary of a village in the
  eastern province of Zhejiang, said the government listened too
  much to the demands of ""selfish city people"" and could raise city
  grain prices without any problem.
      But the government has ruled out a price rise. ""Raising the
  price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social
  stability,"" said a China Daily editorial this month.
      The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the
  long term. ""We must be very careful. We have a very large
  population which is used to price stability and will object to
  price rises,"" he said. ""The problem is how to do it.""
      The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might
  also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with
  grain and consumed by city residents.
      In addition, the state faces the problem of inadequate
  investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.
      The official press has reported that farmers fear farm
  policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into
  building graves, memorial halls for ancestors and homes.
      Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s, farmers sign
  contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops,
  but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.
      ""As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at

"WORLD BANK CHIEF PLEDGES SUPPORT TO INDONESIA
  World Bank president Barber Conable
  pledged the Bank's support to help Indonesia adjust to lower
  world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its
  protected economy was needed.
      Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto,
  he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the
  economy and deregulate trade policy.
      Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which
  cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third
  World's sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs
  from the World Bank in the past 20 years.
      Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300
  mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was
  prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to
  lower oil and primary commodity prices.
      ""We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are
  consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,"" he
  said.
      He said Jakarta's willingness to move quickly after last
  year's collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the
  difficulties now faced by other countries.
      Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the
  dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and
  has announced a series of measures since May intended to
  stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise
  the economy.
      However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics
  and high tariff barriers remain in place.
      Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met
  14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country's
  borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the
  country.

  a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35

      It said a joint field survey late last month by the
  association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand
  indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is
  lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces.
      The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon

"VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE
  Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000
  barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help
  it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister
  Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.
      He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a
  visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister
  Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in
  August.
      Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to
  offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by
  earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.
      Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
  connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao
  was put out of action.
      Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's
  is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to
  allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the
  pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.
      Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels
  shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this
  weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.
      The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by
  Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.

"G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA
  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
  Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed
  their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the
  market of their resolve.
      At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa
  said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a
  totally new statement was needed.
      The speculative selling did not reflect economic
  fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a
  reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he
  said.
      He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had
  concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the
  mark, had remained stable.
      Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the
  Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.
      ""As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression
  of 'current level' is rather vague idea,"" he said.
      The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the
  range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.
      It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing
  a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market,
  Miyazawa said.
      Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the
  statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven
  because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other
  major currencies largely have been stable.
      He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has
  justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other
  nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short
  period since the Paris agreement.
      Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese
  semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7
  meeting and did not affect the currency talks.
      The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing
  countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative

"EC SOURCES SAY UK WHEAT PLAN YET TO BE APPROVED
  The European Commission has not taken a
  decision on applications from the British government for the
  release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the
  British market in May and June, Commission sources said.
      They said last week's cereals management committee agreed
  to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders
  between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to
  allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23.
      However, it decided to leave consideration of the release
  of further wheat until later.
      The British government had applied for the release of a
  further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British
  intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.
      However, the sources said, the Commission wanted to review
  the market situation nearer the time before giving its
  approval.
      The Commission was given new powers last year to control
  the release of intervention cereals onto the market, the
  sources noted.
      Following last week's committee meeting, the U.K. Ministry
  of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that
  additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made
  available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged

"RENISON GOLDFIELDS EXTENDS LYELL COPPER MINE LIFE
  The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd
  &lt;RGFJ.S> (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open
  for an extra five years following a new aid package from the
  state government, RGC said in a statement.
      The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40
  series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the
  deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.
      The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved the
  local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and
  justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of
  about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said.
      Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep
  contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000
  tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln
  dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.
      The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a
  major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast
  of Tasmania.
      The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10
  mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr
  advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions
  and deferred royalties and payroll taxes.

"COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS
  Coffee prices may have to fall even lower
  to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the
  negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and
  traders said.
      The failure last night of International Coffee
  Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree
  export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee
  futures markets today with the London May price reaching a
  4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before
  ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous
  close.
      The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.
      Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the
  ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope
  the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor
  under prices, some senior traders said.
      The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for
  March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents
  a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in
  February last year following a sharp rise in international
  prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.
      In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC,
  President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said
  they need to make hard commercial decisions. ""If we have failed
  at the ICO, at least we have tried,"" Dauster said, adding ""now it
  is time to go and sell coffee.""
      But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans
  to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next
  month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade
  sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a
  previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public
  selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market
  last year.
      A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the
  market ""in one go"" but is sold over a minimum of six months.
      The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split
  between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for
  future quotas. Consumers said ""objective criteria"" like average
  exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares,
  Dauster said.
      All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but
  consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ""ad hoc"" way
  of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst
  producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.
      Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and
  non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and
  that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set
  ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.
      It is a ""simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate""
  policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome
  to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very
  difficult to allocate as different ""objective criteria"" achieve
  different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.
      Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO
  and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.
      Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to
  accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves
  impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.
      ""We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to
  encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if
  supplies are needed at a later stage,"" one delegate said.
      Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer
  argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO
  session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse
  and how much producers will sink their differences should
  prices fall further and remain depressed.
      The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but
  both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real
  negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in
  Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.
      More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and
  politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could
  bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than
  many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during
  the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before
  October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has
  continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.
      A clear difference between the pressures already being felt
  by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been
  happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could
  not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could
  show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.
      In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the
  seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to
  lapse should lasting agreement not be found.
      ""Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their
  failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient
  and we wanted a cast iron commitment now,"" one consumer said.

"SEA CONTAINERS &lt;SCR> EXPECTS BETTER FIRST QTR
  Sea Containers Ltd predicted
  its first quarter fiscal 1987 net earnings would improve by 10
  mln dlrs over the same period a year ago.
      The company said 1987 got off on a much better footing than
  fiscal 1986, from which the company recorded a loss of 67.6 mln
  dlrs, or 6.28 dlrs per share, on revenues of 641.4 mln dlrs.
      James Sherwood, president of the company, said he expects
  to record a loss of approximately 12 mln dlrs for the first
  quarter, compared to losses of approximately 22 mln dlrs for
  first quarter fiscal 1986.
      The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally
  slow period for the ferry industry, which is  part of Sea
  Containers' business.
      Sherwoood said the company's losses were largely
  attributable to non-recurring events and provisions. He cited
  the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers,
  costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs.
      He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing
  two of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr
  provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and
  severance pay costs.

"BALLADUR INSISTS ON MAINTENANCE OF LOUVRE ACCORDS
  French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur
  issued a firm call for the continued faithful application of
  the Louvre accords on currency stability by all major
  industrial countries.
      Balladur, responding to weekend remarks by U.S. Treasury
  Secretary James Baker that the U.S. Would take another look at
  the accords, said ""I firmly desire a faithfull and firm
  adherence by all the major industrial countries to the Louvre
  accords -- in both their letter and spirit.""
      On Sunday, Baker said last week's rise in short-term West
  German interest rates was not in keeping with the accords.
      The Louvre accords, agreed in Paris last February, called
  for stability among the major currencies after a prolonged
  dollar slide.
      The accords were reaffirmed by the Group of Seven Finance
  Ministers in Washington last month.
      But Baker said at the weekend that the West German rate
  rise was ""not in keeping with the spirit of what we agreed to.""
      ""What I'm really saying is that they should not expect us to
  simply sit back here and accept increased tightening on their
  part on the assumption that somehow we are going to follow
  them,"" he added.

  The U.S. Agriculture Department is

      The changes in the standards would include the following:
      -- Establishing equal tolerances for the number of live
  insects in shipments of food grains, feed grains and oilseeds.
      -- Revising the definition of ""infested"" to give equal value
  to all insects injurious to grain.
      -- Establishing lower levels of infestations. In 1988, the
  infested level would be set at three or more live insects per
  representative sample (about 100 grams), in 1990 two or more

  deposits in the following ranges: copper, 3.7 pct to 5.08 pct,

  pct to 79.92 oz per ton, gold .062 to .19 oz per ton, germanium
  93 to 103 grams per ton, gallium five to 18 grams per ton.
      In addition, Houston Metals said the weighted average of 25
  diamond-drilled holes 375 ft below the 2,600 foot level and 800
  ft along the strike assayed gold at .237 oz per ton, silver at
  10.91 oz per ton and zinc at 8.99 pct.
      An apparent parallel vein structure at the 2,600 ft level
  returned similar values, the company said.
      It added that preliminary metallurgical tests from
  representative bulk ore samples indicate the commercial
  feasability of producing a zinc and a copper-lead concentrate.

"BASF &lt;BASF.F> SAYS 1986 RESULTS AFFECTED BY DLR
  BASF AG said
  the volatile currency situation last year, particularly the
  fall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominated
  in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic
  production.
      But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group
  said it expected satisfactory business development over the
  next months. ""At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary
  influences such as there were last year,"" it said. Orders in
  hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.
      BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax
  profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.
      The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year
  also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and
  forced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.
      The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on
  stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In
  the parent company, the positive earnings development
  continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to
  1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was
  balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in
  raw materials. 
      In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47
  billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell
  8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.
      Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine
  chemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in
  those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.
      Results from these had been taken only partly into the
  fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.
      So far in the current year, the investment volume of the
  parent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986,
  BASF said, without giving concrete figures.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - DUTCH EXCHANGE RATE POLICY
  Recent slackness on Dutch capital
  markets has led some bankers to question the Central Bank's
  policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the West German mark
  and to ask for more flexiblility in exchange rate policy.
      While agreeing with the Bank's commitment to defend the
  guilder strongly, some bankers want the Bank to make more use
  of the range within which the guilder and the mark can
  fluctuate against each other in the European Monetary System
  (EMS).
      Roelof Nelissen, chairman of Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV
  (Amro) said the Central Bank's policy was overcautious.
      ""I would like to suggest that the Bank use more freely the
  range given to the guilder in the EMS,"" Nelissen said at the
  presentation of Amro's 1986 annual report last week.
      Within the EMS, the mark is allowed to fluctuate against
  the guilder between 110.1675 and 115.235 guilders per 100.
      The Central Bank maintains a stricter policy and tries to
  keep the mark below the 113.00 guilders per 100. It regards a
  stable exchange rate as its main target, using interest rate
  policies to influence the exchange rate.
      The preference of exchange rate goals above interest rate
  aims goes almost undisputed in the Netherlands.
      Critics say the Bank keeps the reins unnecessarily short.
      Rabobank Nederland said in its latest economic bulletin: ""By
  maintaining the 113.00 limit, the Central Bank raises the
  expectation it will always intervene above that level. If it
  suddenly needs more flexibility it will find it very hard to
  obtain.""
      Amro's Nelissen said relatively small changes in interest
  rates and exchange rates could cause substantial flows of
  securities business and sharp fluctuations on the Dutch capital
  market. Large interest rate changes were often needed to bring
  about small changes in the guilder/mark exchange rate, he
  added.
      Unlike Amro, Algemene Bank Nederland NV (ABN) says this is
  a price the Dutch have to pay. It fully agrees with the Central
  Bank's policy, director-general Julien Geertsema told Reuters,
  noting a 1983 decision not to revalue the guilder fully with
  the mark in the EMS hurt confidence in the Dutch currency.
      ""It is a pity we need such a wide interest rate difference
  between West Germany to maintain the exchange rate,"" he added.
      Interest rate differentials between West Germany and the
  Netherlands are the main factors that trigger capital flows
  between the two countries, as the economic performance of the
  two does not differ much, economists said.
      Data on 1986 capital flows between West Germany and the
  Netherlands have not yet been released, but in 1985 they
  accounted for only 10 pct of total trade flows between the two
  countries, put at 110 billion guilders for 1986 by the
  Dutch-German Chamber of Commerce earlier this month.
      Economists say capital flows are more sensitive to interest
  and exchange rates.
      West Germany is the Netherlands' largest single trading
  partner, taking 28 pct of Dutch exports and providing 26 pct of
  imports in the last quarter of 1986, Central Bureau of
  Statistics figures show.
      At the moment, the rates for three month euromark deposits
  trade around 4.0 pct while the same deposits in guilders have a
  rate of around 5-7/16 pct.
      Amro bank argues that the Dutch real interest rate will
  even rise further because of expectations of deflation here in
  1987, contrasting with slight inflation in West Germany.
      In the Netherlands, the cost of living is expected to
  decrease by 1.5 pct at a GNP growth rate of two pct, the Dutch
  Central Planning Agency said in its 1987 forecast last month.
  German GNP is seen rising by two to 2.5 pct, but with inflation
  between zero and 1.0 pct, according to most German forecasts.
      But despite this upward push on real Dutch rates, money
  dealers do not expect the Central Bank to cut official rates
  independently without prior moves by the Bundesbank.
      Following the West German interest rate cuts on January 22,
  the Dutch Central Bank did not lower its rates but set a 0.5
  pct lower tariff for special advances and abandoned its credit
  surcharge. Most traders were surprised by this move as they had
  expected the Bank to follow suit unconditionally, they said.
      The Bank said it lowered the rate with the largest impact
  on the money market as far as the exchange rate permitted.
      While not entirely unsympathetic to critics of its
  policies, the Central Bank keeps its grip firm and the range
  narrow.
      ""The European Monetary System is not only a relationship
  between the guilder and the mark. Many times widening of the
  margin between the two would implicate we have to buy or sell
  large amounts of a third currency,"" Central Bank vice-director
  Jan-Hendrik Du Marchie Sarvaas said.
      ""If we allowed the guilder to become a little cheaper, the
  markets would start to believe it was weak. We don't want that.
  We want to make clear that the guilder is just as strong as the
  mark,"" he said.

"EXXON &lt;XON> OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION ROSE IN 1986
  Exxon Corp said in its annual report
  that it raised production in 1986 although it did not replace
  all oil and gas produced.
      The company said that it added about four pct to production
  bringing it to 1.8 mln bpd, the highest level since 1979, based
  largely on increased production of oil overseas but additions
  to its reserves from new discoveries and reserve acquisitions
  did not replace all of the oil and gas produced.
      The company said that the average price for oil and gas
  declined 41 pct in 1986 from the previous year sparking a 38
  pct decline in its earnings from exploration and production.
      Exxon's earnings from exploration and production in 1986
  fell to 3.1 billion dlrs from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Exxon said that its principal gains in production came from
  the Gulf of Mexico, Alaska, the North Sea, Malaysia and from
  oil sands in Canada.
      Exxon also said that it acquired 11.2 mln acres for
  expoloration spread over 10 countries including the U.S, Europe
  and the Far East.
      But capital expenditures for exploration and production
  were cut to 4.6 billion dlrs from 7.6 billion the previous year
  and further reductions were expected in 1987.
      Exxon said that its net share of crude oil and natural gas
  liquids produced from offshore fields in the North Sea reached
  a new high of 422,000 bpd.
      The light, sweet crudes produced from these North Sea
  fields also gave the company trading gains as Exxon was able to
  sell much of this crude and replace it with cheaper, lower
  quality crude oil for its refineries which have been upgraded
  over the past several years.
      The trading gains and lower acquisition costs gave Exxon
  more of a spread in its refinery operations and added to
  earnings gains from refining and marketing.
      Exxon said earnings from refining and marketing operations
  rose to nearly two billion dlrs in 1986, up from 872 mln dlrs
  in 1985.
      The company said petroleum sales slipped slightly to 4.043
  mln barrels per day from 4.082 mln bpd in 1985 while crude runs
  rose to 3.0 mln bpd from 2.9 mln bpd the previous year.
      Exxon's refinery operations benefited from a three year 500
  mln dlr upgrading program to its Baytown, Texas refinery
  completed last October and an 850 mln dlr upgrading project in
  Rotterdam both of which emphasize utilizing lower grade crudes
  to extract higher proportions of light products.

"KUWAIT REJECTS IRANIAN SPY BOAT CHARGES
  Kuwait, a target of Iranian anger over the
  emirate's backing for Iraq in the Gulf war, today rejected
  charges that fishing vessels seized recently by Iran were spy
  boats.
      ""There are no bases of truth to the contents of the Iranian
  accusation on the nature of the operations of the vessels
  recently taken into custody by Iran. These vessels were out
  fishing,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
      It said Iranian Charge d'Affaires Mohammad Baqeri was
  summoned by the Ministry yesterday to confer with Foreign
  Undersecretary Suleiman Majed al-Shaheen.
      The Iranian News Agency IRNA said on Sunday Iran had seized
  seven Kuwaiti speed boats and detained their crew, who
  confessed to spying for Iraq under the cover of fishing.
      It said the boats were intercepted in the Khur Abdullah
  waterway which separates Kuwait and Iraq's Faw peninsula at the
  head of the Gulf, captured by Iran last year.
      The Kuwaiti response came as Iranian envoys toured Gulf
  Arab states saying responsibility for security and stability in
  the waterway was a regional matter. A U.S. Senate team was
  scheduled today to meet Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime
  Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah and the defence and
  oil ministers.
      Today's Foreign Ministry statement, carried by the Kuwait
  News Agency KUNA, said the recent detention of Kuwaiti fishing
  vessels by Iran was not the first.
      Tehran in the past had held back a number of vessels Kuwait
  had sought to release through diplomatic contacts, it said.
      ""However, Kuwait is perplexed that this time the Iranian
  charges are accompanied by accusations that the vessels were
  undertaking espionage activities,"" it said.
      Shaheen condemned the detentions and accusations, and asked
  Tehran to free all fishing boats and sailors held by Iran, the
  statement said.

"TAKEOVER BATTLE FOR DOME PETROLEUM BEGINS
  A takeover battle began today for
  debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> as TransCanada
  PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
  Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
      Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
  buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70
  pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>
  which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
  &lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.
      Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
  proposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with a
  third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
  statement.
      The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
  but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
      TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
  operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
  and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
  would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
  is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
      Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
  totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
  It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
      Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated
  the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
  into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to
  prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
      It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and
  substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
  provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and
  financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
      TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
  was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
  that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's
  statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
  authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
  it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
  other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
      Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
  Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
  5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

"SWEDEN REVISES DOWN JANUARY'S INFLATION FIGURE
  Sweden's rate of inflation during
  January has been revised downwards after a fault was made in
  calculating the figures, the Central Bureau of Statistics said.
      The January rise in consumer prices was 1.0 pct instead of
  the previously announced 1.3 pct, the bureau said, without
  explaining how the error arose.
      Consumer prices in February rose 0.3 pct compared with 0.1
  pct in February last year, the bureau said. The total inflation
  rate so far this year is therefore 1.3 pct, allowing for
  January's revised figures, it added.
      Year-on-year inflation rose to 3.4 pct in February, against
  a revised 3.2 pct in January and a year-on-year rate of 5.3 pct
  in February 1986, the bureau said.
      The slowdown in price rises was mainly due to a government
  imposed price freeze which came into force on February 4, the

"TRADE BILL TO CHANGE AGRICULTURE TRADE LAWS
  The House Ways and Means Committee
  is moving toward passage of a trade bill that sponsors said was
  intended to help open foreign markets to U.S. agricultural
  goods and to modify some U.S. agricultural trade laws.
      The trade subcommittee voted to require President Reagan to
  take into account the potential harm to U.S. agricultural
  exports of any trade retaliation he might impose for foreign
  unfair trade practices against other domestic industries.
      The bill would allow U.S. agricultural producers to seek
  government monitoring of imports if there is a reasonable
  chance the industry would be harmed by an import surge.
      The full Ways and Means Committee is to consider the bill
  next week and congressional sources said they expect it will be
  approved.
       In investigations involving a processed agricultural
  product, trade associations of processors or producers would
  have to petition for relief from foreign dumping or unfair
  duties.
       The bill sets out U.S. trade negotiating objectives for
  the Uruguay round of talks under the General Agreement on
  Tariffs and Trade. It would seek fair trade in agriculture,
  seek to discipline restrictive or trade distorting import and
  export practices, to eliminate tariffs, subsidies, quotas and
  non-tariff barriers.
       President Reagan's authority to negotiate a new GATT
  agreement would be extended through January 1993 and authority
  to negotiate a free trade zone with Canada would be extended
  through January 3, 1991.
      The bill extends Reagan's authority to negotiate an
  international coffee agreement through October 31, 1989.
      It allows a refund of import duties paid on raw sugar
  imported from November 1, 1977 to March 31, 1985 for production
  of sugar or products containing sugar and destined for
  re-export. The export of the sugar or products must occur
  before Octoer 1, 1991.
      Presently, to qualify for the refund the sugar must be
  processed within three years after import and exported within
  five years.
      Agriculture would also benefit from more rapid decisions in
  complaints of unfair foreign trade practices or injury from
  imports.

"WEST GERMAN BANKS SLOWLY CUTTING KEY SAVINGS RATES
  West German commercial banks are
  cautiously cutting key savings and lending rates, banking
  sources said. The cuts follow nearly two months after the
  Bundesbank reduced leading interest rates, far longer than the
  usual interim period.
      A Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> spokesman said it is cutting
  leading savings rate for private customers on a regional basis
  by 0.5 percentage points to two pct. Dresdner Bank AG &lt;DRSD.F>
  and Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> have initiated similar moves. Bank
  fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG &lt;BKFG.F> cut rates 0.5 pct generally.
      The delay was partly due to commercial banks' desire to
  gauge customer reaction to a similar move by regional savings
  banks.
      A fall in customer savings because of lower rates could
  reduce cheap refinancing available to banks, forcing them to
  draw down relatively expensive funds from other sources, one
  economist at the German Banking Association said.
      But the volume of savings funds may not be substantially
  undercut by lower savings rates because many customers are
  parking funds in savings accounts in the hope they can reinvest
  them at higher yields in the future, he said.
      He said this may conflict with Bundesbank aims to move more
  funds from relatively short-term deposits to longer-dated
  securities to reduce strong growth in its central bank money
  supply aggregate.
      The aggregate showed annualized growth of a provisional 7.5
  pct in February against the fourth quarter of last year,
  unchanged from January. The growth rate was outside the
  expanded target range of three to six pct.
      Few banks have so far reduced lending rates to private
  customers, though lending rates for corporate customers are
  beginning to decline.

"U.S. MAKES CONCILIATORY MOVE AT RUBBER PACT TALKS
  The U.S. Has dropped its insistence that
  the floor price in a new International Natural Rubber
  Agreement, INRA, be revised downward under certain
  circumstances, conference sources said.
      The surprise conciliatory move by the U.S. Meets one of the
  producers' main concerns -- that the floor price, or ""lower
  indicative price,"" remain unchanged, they said.
      It is not clear, however, whether all consuming countries
  will follow suit, as a number of them, in particular Britain,
  West Germany and Belgium, appeared to have strong reservations,
  the sources added.

  cents a kilo in the present pact) if the buffer stock,
  currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.

"PENNZOIL (PZL) WILLING TO SETTLE TEXACO (TX) LAWSUIT
  Pennzoil Co said it had not yet
  received any ""meaningful settlement offer"" from Texaco Inc but
  added that the company remained willing to consider proposals
  to settle the 10.2 billion dlr jury judgment it won against
  Texaco.
      In its newly-released annual report to shareholders,
  Pennzoil said it expected the Texas state court judgment, which
  was upheld by a state appeals court on February 12, to be
  upheld if appealed again.
      ""To date, Pennzoil has yet to receive any meaningful
  settlement offer from Texaco, though it remains open to any
  realistic effort to settle the matter,"" Pennzoil chairman Hugh
  Liedtke said in the annual report.
      Pennzoil also said it had budgeted 212 mln dlrs for capital
  spending in 1987, a drop from the 233 mln dlrs spent last year.
      Proved U.S. and foreign reserves of natural gas declined to
  964 billion cubic feet last year, from 1.01 trillion cubic feet
  in 1985, because of a virtual halt in its exploration program,
  Pennzoil said. Its crude oil reserves dropped to 140 mln
  barrels from 158 mln barrels in 1985.
       The Houston-based company said it sold an average of 339
  mln cubic feet of domestic natural gas each day last year, a 17
  pct drop from 1985. The average sales price for gas dropped by
  60 cents per mcf to 2.16 dlrs per mcf, Pennzoil said.
      U.S. crude oil and gas liquids production last year fell to
  an average of 33,290 barrels per day from 34,102 barrels per
  day in 1985.
      The company's total revenues in 1986 declined to 482.3 mln
  dlrs, from 762.5 mln dlrs the previous year. Operating income
  in 1986 fell more than 80 pct, to 38.0 mln dlrs.
      Pennzoil said its goals for 1987 included development of
  its Point Arguello oilfield off the California coast, to
  maintain current production levels in its Bluebell-Altamont
  Field in Utah and to drill for prospects in the Gulf of
  Mexico's Mobile Bay area.
      ""Production should begin late in the year from the Harvest
  Platform in the Santa Maria Basin offshore California,"" the
  company said. ""Pennzoil's share of this production initially
  should be five thousand barrels a day, increasing to a peak of
  15 thousand barrels a day, net, by 1989.""
      In its sulphur business, Pennzoil said production totaled
  2.1 mln long tons last year, a decline of 18 pct from 1985. The
  average sales price also declined, to 138.25 dlrs per long ton
  from 141.05 dlrs in 1985.
      ""The long term outlook for our sulphur operations remains
  bright,"" the company said. ""We expect sulphur's pricing
  structure to strengthen during the current year, probably in
  the third and fourth quarters.""

"ITALY SAYS G-7 GIVES CHANCE TO VERIFY TOKYO ACCORD
  This week's Group of Seven (G-7) meeting in
  Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached
  at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in
  Group of Five (G-5) talks on management of the international
  monetary system and related issues, the Italian Treasury said.
      It said in a statement the G-7 meeting, which Italy plans
  to attend, will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo
  accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year.
      On February 22, Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its
  G-7 partners - the United States, Japan, West Germany, France,
  Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier
  session of talks involving G-5 members.
      Today's statement from the Italian Treasury said-
      ""Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it to
  be remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for the
  enlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever ""the
  management or the improvement of the international monetary
  economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with.'""
      Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the
  grounds that G-5, grouping the United States, Japan, West
  Germany, France and Britain, had reduced Italy's role to rubber
  stamping agreements already taken.
      The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was ""certain that
  this time incidents would not occur.""
      But it said it would be opportune to look in depth at the
  role and the procedures of G-7 in relation to those of G-5.

"U.S. ECONOMY SHOWS PROMISING SIGNS OF GROWTH
  The U.S. economy is showing some
  promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the
  sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private
  economists say.
      Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December
  period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter
  this year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in
  January slowed business and consumer spending.
      But some of the latest economic data show signs of
  surprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some
  economists remain cautious about the outlook.
      The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for
  durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct
  rise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense
  goods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency
  said.
      The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many
  financial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to
  increases of up to five pct.
      The January/February employment statistics suggest the
  Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for
  the first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an
  economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
      The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct,
  the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm
  jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in
  January and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.
      The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of
  about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.
      Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding
  their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the
  second quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the
  second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption
  and government spending. He also sees residential construction
  declining mostly for multi-family housing units.
      Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the
  fourth quarter slowness will continue.
      Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the
  first quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and
  show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.
      The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the
  U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in
  the dollar's value over the last year and half.
      ""The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,"" Levy
  predicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at
  least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the
  prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.
      The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit,
  which soared to record levels last year, will improve this year
  and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the
  year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.
      As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S.
  has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their
  domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.
      U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the
  pressure off the United States whose five years of economic
  growth has been the mainstay of developing countries.
      The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for
  their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to
  service their foreign debt.
      The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a
  modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.
      There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance
  between the volume of goods imported to the United States and
  those shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of
  exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact
  that in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened
  during the closing three months of 1986.
      While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate
  profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the
  government said. It also reported that inflation, as measured
  by the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a
  moderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.
      The government also reported that consumer spending, a key
  element of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in
  February, after falling two pct in January.
      The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the
  manufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements
  of the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.
      In its latest report on current economic conditions, the
  Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the
  country ranged from uneven or steady to improving.
  Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most
  regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.
      Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the
  pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the
  drop in the dollar's value. He said he does not foresee a major
  pick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy
  will slip into recession either.
      He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts
  that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze
  consumers purchasing power.
      ""That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of
  years,"" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around
  a modest two pct level for the next few years.

"REAGAN SAYS U.S. NEEDS TO LESSEN OIL IMPORTS
  President Reagan said the United

      ""We have to study this more,"" Reagan said. ""This is why we

"SPAIN TO RELAX EXCHANGE CONTROLS
  The Bank of Spain is relaxing exchange
  controls to help put Spanish banks on an equal footing with
  European Community competitors by the 1993 deadline for the
  ending of restrictions, a central bank spokesman said.
      ""The measures to take effect by June were designed to lift
  restrictions on foreign currency operations, in line with
  deregulation in the banking industry,"" he said in a telephone
  interview.
      The spokesman said the relaxation of exchange controls
  highlighted a broader package of reforms announced last Friday.
      The central bank said in a statement the measures included
  increased provisions for high-risk borrowers and a provision
  for future pension fund obligations.
      It said the measures were the latest steps to deregulate
  Spain's financial sector, a move triggered by entry into the
  Community last year.
      Spain has five years to complete bank deregulation, a
  process that began in 1978 when the government allowed foreign
  banks to open branches.
      Since then 39 foreign banks have come into the market and
  they now control about 15 pct of the system's lending assets.
      Residents in Spain can now borrow freely in foreign
  currency up to the equivalent of 1.5 billion pesetas against a
  previous ceiling of 750 mln pesetas.
      The 750 mln peseta limit was set last March. Between that
  date and the end of last year some 430 mln dlrs flowed into the
  country on new foreign currency loans.
      The central bank spokesman said operations over 1.5 billion
  pesetas were technically subject to authorisation, but would be
  given clearance if the government failed to act in 15 days.
      Spanish banks will also be allowed to expand their foreign
  currency funding, formerly obtainable through deposits, by
  issuing certificates of deposit, bonds and commercial paper.
      They can also employ these funds to invest in foreign
  issues, while before they had to be converted into deposits.
      Foreign exchange operations can be in mixed currencies,
  instead of having to borrow and lend in the same currency.
      The central bank has also lifted the restriction on the
  amount of foreign exchange loans, which previously were limited
  to three times a bank's capital equity.
      The latest deregulation measures were welcomed by most
  bankers, in contrast to rulings issued earlier this month which
  imposed a 19 pct reserve requirement on new convertible peseta
  funds held by banks and freed short term deposit rates.
      The reserve requirement, which was already in place on
  normal peseta deposits, was intended to curb short-term foreign
  speculative capital which is entering the country and
  threatening the government's money supply growth target.
      A foreign banker said high reserve requirements, which now
  account for about 30 pct of deposits, placed Spanish banks at a
  disadvantage with European competitors.
      The government reduced fixed asset investment requirements
  to 11 pct from 23 pct to help offset the negative impact of
  interest rate deregulation. ""The real problem is the freeing of
  interest rates,"" the banker said. ""This is going to take a big
  bite out of profits.""
      The ruling lifted a six pct ceiling on interest rates paid
  on deposits of up to 180 days.
      The chairman of one of Spain's leading banks said the
  measure was expected to bring a 20 pct drop in profits this
  year.

"SUGAR PRICES TOO LOW TO BOOST LATIN OUTPUT
  Latin American sugar producers
  are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving
  to boost production, official and trade sources said.
      Although prices have risen to around eight from five U.S.
  Cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the
  region's nine to ten cents per lb average production cost.
      The recent rise in prices has placed producers on the
  alert, Manuel Rico, a consultant with the Group of Latin
  American and Caribbean Sugar Exporting Countries (GEPLACEA),
  told Reuters.
      However, Rico said, it would require another five to seven
  cents to stimulate notable increases in output.
      ""Producers are taking measures for increasing their
  production when the prices are profitable,"" he said.
      Officials in Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador said a continued
  rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders
  in Panama and Costa Rica said there was still a long way to go.
      ""The prices are ridiculous,"" said Julian Mateo, vice
  president of Costa Rica's Sugar Cane Industrial-Agricultural
  League. ""At current prices nobody is going to consider
  increasing production.""
      Other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing
  output, given the instability of world markets.
      An official at Colombia's National Association of Sugar
  Cane Growers said they had no plans to raise export targets.
  ""The market is very unstable. What is happening is not yet
  giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify
  anything.""
      In 1985, the latest year for which full figures are
  available, Central and South American nations produced 28 mln
  tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which 12.3 mln were exported. A
  year earlier, they had produced and exported about 800,000
  more, according to the London-based International Sugar
  Organization.
      Years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar
  industry in many countries in the region into a recession from
  which it will be hard to recover.
      Miguel Guerrero, director of the Dominican Republic's
  National Sugar Institute, said it would be difficult to boost
  production even if prices recovered sharply.
      Output had slumped to under 450,000 tonnes a year from
  900,000 in the late 1970s. Obsolete refineries, poor transport
  and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short
  term recovery in output, he added.
      Plans of nearby Cuba, the world's largest cane sugar
  exporter, to increase output to 10 mln tonnes a year by the end
  of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said. Output is
  running well below the record 8.6 mln produced in 1970.
      Cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems
  and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices,
  since much of its output is sold to Eastern Bloc countries
  under special deals. Last year, bad weather added to its
  troubles, and output fell to 7.2 mln tonnes from 8.2 mln in
  1985.
      The low world prices of recent years have led many
  countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels
  where they barely cover U.S. And, in the case of some Caribbean
  countries, European Community (EC) import quotas, for which
  they receive prices well above free market levels.
      Progressive reductions in the U.S. Quotas have led to
  production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to
  the free world market.
      Peru, for example, shipped 96,000 tonnes to the U.S. In
  both 1983 and 1984. This fell to 76,000 in 1986 and this year
  its quota is only 37,000.
      A national cooperative official said that, as long as world
  market levels continue at around half of Peru's production
  cost, the future of the industry is uncertain.
      At a meeting of GEPLACEA in Brazil last October officials
  stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane
  which, according to the group's executive-secretary Eduardo
  Latorre, ""grows like a weed"" throughout the region.
      Brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around 240
  mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel. Cane in
  excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into
  sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency.
      The difference in the price the state-run Sugar and Alcohol
  Institute (IAA) pays local industry and what it receives from
  foreign buyers costs the government some 350 mln dlrs a year.
      Soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the
  past year, coupled with a drought-reduced cane crop, has meant
  Brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in
  1987, trade sources said. Negotiations to delay shipments to
  next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point
  being how Brazil should compensate buyers for non-delivery of
  sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would
  cost eight cents to replace.
      Brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export
  sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with
  the Institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of
  either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild
  depleted reserve stockpiles.
      However, the situation could change dramatically if the
  economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps.
      Sources within Latin America and the Caribbean hold little
  hope for the region's sugar industry to return to profitability
  unless the U.S. And EC change their policies.
      ""The agricultural policies of the European Community and of
  the United States have caused our economies incalculable harm
  by closing their markets, by price deterioration in
  international commerce and furthermore by the unfair
  competition in third countries,"" Brazil's Trade and Industry
  Minister Jose Hugo Castelo Branco told the October GEPLACEA
  meeting.
      The EC has come under prolonged attack from GEPLACEA for
  what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess
  output on world markets. GEPLACEA officials say this is the
  main cause of low prices.
      GEPLACEA sees a new International Sugar Agreement which
  would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the
  region's industry out of steady decline. Such an agreement
  would have to have both U.S. And EC backing and industrialised
  countries would have to see it as a political rather than a
  merely economic pact.
      ""They have to realise that the more our economies suffer,
  the less capcity we have to buy their goods and repay the
  region's 360 billion dollar foreign debt,"" GEPLACEA's Latorre
  said.

  RepublicBank Corp said it has placed

      It said the reclassification will reduce first quarter

  taxes for all of 1987, if Brazil does not change its position
  of a moratorium on interest payments.
      RepublicBank also said its net income for the first quarter
  is expected to be about 10.4 mln dlrs or 30 cts a share on a

  earned 23.1 mln dlrs or 75 cts a share.
      The company also said its first quarter results are
  expected to include a provision for loan losses of 55 mln dlrs,
  about 20 mln dlrs over net loan-charge-offs of about 35 mln
  dlrs. It said the provision will increase loan losses to about
  328 mln dlrs or 2.2 pct of loans.

"SALOMON RAISES CATERPILLAR &lt;CAT> OPINION
  Salomon Brothers Inc said it raised
  its opinion on Caterpillar Inc's stock to an aggressive buy
  from a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988.
      Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees
  1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecast
  of three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at
  2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.
      Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.
      ""Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,
  we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second
  half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through
  1988 and 1989,"" he said.
      Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors
  - higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, and
  improved demand.
      The higher prices will stick because its Japanese
  competitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of the
  increased value of the yen, he said.

  1985 levels when the company earned 152 mln U.S. dlrs or 1.70

      ""We'll have a substantial increase in earnings from
  continuing operations,"" he told reporters after the annual

      In 1986, profits from continuing operations slumped to
  139.5 mln dlrs or 1.54 dlrs a share. The total excluded losses
  of 30 mln dlrs on discontinued operations.
      Goodrich said Moore is still actively looking for

      ""We could do a large acquisition,"" he said when asked if
  the company could raise as much as one billion dlrs for this

      Chairman Judson Sinclair, answering a shareholder's
  question, told the annual meeting that a special resolution
  passed by shareholders to create a new class of preferred
  shares would allow Moore to move quickly if it decided to
  pursue an acquisition.

"U.S. SENATE PANEL APPROVES TRADE MISSION BILL
  The U.S. Senate Agriculture
  Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and
  aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid, donation,
  credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.
      The bill, approved by voice vote, would establish trade
  missions made up of representatives of the Departments of
  Agriculture and State, the Agency for International
  Development, the Overseas Private Investment Corp, market
  development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.
      At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year
  after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S.
  programs, including PL480, Section 416 donations, Export
  Enhancement Program, the dairy export incentive program, and
  export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102, GSM-103).
      The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill,
  offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.), that would have
  required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one
  mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.
      Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750,000 tonnes
  of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food
  donation program.
      The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed
  increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up
  to 50 mln dlrs per year, Senate staff said.
      The committee also dropped a provision identifying which
  countries would be the focus of the trade missions' activities.
      Under the bill adopted by the committee, countries ""friendly
  to the United States"" would be eligible to host the trade
  missions.
      Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico,
  the Philippines, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Senegal, Nigeria, Peru,
  Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Malaysia, Venezuela,
  Tunisia and Morocco.
      The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural
  Service, FAS, to have at least 850 full-time employees during
  fiscal years 1987-89. As of February 28, FAS had 790 full-time
  employees, a FAS spokesman said.

      Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January

      Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he

"U.S. AGENCY RULES AGAINST BRAZIL ORANGE JUICE
  The U.S. International Trade
  Commission, ITC, voted to authorize the Commerce Department to
  impose anti-dumping duties on imports of Brazilian frozen
  concentrated orange juice.
      The ITC voted 3-2 in favor of the anti-dumping petition in
  its final ruling on the matter.
      Today's ITC ruling was consistent with the Commerce
  Department's final ruling of March 9, and activates an
  anti-dumping duty of 1.96 pct on imports of Brazilian frozen
  concentrated orange juice, Stephen Vastagh, ITC investigator
  said.
      The ITC found that Brazilian orange juice imports have
  injured U.S. producers. The Commerce Department had already
  ruled that the imports were unfairly priced, and lowered to
  1.96 pct the anti-dumping margin that in a preliminary decision
  last fall had been set at 8.5 pct, Vastagh said.
      The U.S. government has been requiring bond to be posted on
  imports of Brazilian frozen concentrated orange juice since
  Commerce's preliminary ruling of last October 23, he said.
      Commerce had ruled that one major Brazilian producer --
  Cutrale -- would be excluded from the anti-dumping duty.
      Brazilian imports account for about 40 pct of total U.S.
  supply, Vastagh said. Between December 1985 and November 1986,
  the United States imported the equivalent of 546 mln gallons of
  Brazilian orange juice worth 622 mln dlrs, he said.
      Currently, the United States requires a 35-cent per gallon
  tariff on orange juice imports, Vastagh said.
      An ITC spokesman said the agency would forward its final
  report on the anti-dumping case to Commerce by April 22.
      Commerce then will process the anti-dumping order and
  transmit it to U.S Customs, which will liquidate bond entries
  dating from Commerce's preliminary ruling and begin assessing
  duties, Vastagh said.
      He said about 12 Brazilian orange juice exporters,
  including three major shippers, would be affected by the
  decision.

  pct growth registered last year, the Council said in a report

"POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE - SOURCES
  Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl
  told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut
  leading interest rates again if the United States makes a
  similar move, banking sources said.
      The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium
  in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press
  representatives were not invited.
      The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200
  bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates
  would give room for a matching measure in Germany.
      ""It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates,"" said
  one banker who attended the symposium.
      A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no
  comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.
      But, according to a second source, who also declined to be
  identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a
  direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend
  German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.
      ""He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the
  Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly,""
  the second source said.
      In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut
  in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the
  U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to
  discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such
  a move in advance, the sources said.

  cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early
  as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying,
  ""No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that.""
      The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations
  took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.
      Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks
  between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying
  that financial markets had not fully realised the significance
  of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further
  falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.
      For the first time all participants at the summit agreed
  that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all
  world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.
      The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted
  growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around
  current levels by international central bank cooperation.
      One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact
  that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative
  in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in
  West Germany's economic growth.
      Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past
  stressed that the German central bank had no direct
  responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with
  combatting inflation.
      This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter
  monetary stance from the beginning of December until the
  half-point cut in rates in late January.
      The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current
  overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly
  respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react
  immediately whenever such overshooting occurs.
      Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's
  main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at
  7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.
      Share prices rose in very active trading today, with
  dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish
  outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium,
  brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

"TIN COUNCIL WINDING-UP VERDICT APPEALED
  Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today
  lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its
  petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.
      The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22,
  when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed
  by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the
  collapse of the ITC's buffer stock operations in October 1985.
  AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.
      The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on
  three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of
  the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters.
      The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to
  wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association
  within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the
  winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an
  arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.
      The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the
  winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will
  argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold
  said.
      The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an
  arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the
  court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to
  enforce an arbitration ruling.
      The court originally decided that the winding-up petition
  went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT
  spokesman said.
      The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but
  a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be
  heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a
  receiver appointed over the ITC's assets.
      Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is
  possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be
  consolidated with AMT's appeal, Arnold said.
      Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the
  Council's member states and an application by the governments
  to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner
  (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.
      Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME's tin
  ""ring-out"" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the
  near future. The hearing date has now been put back slightly to
  June 8.

"PHILIPPINE PLANNING CHIEF URGES PESO DEVALUATION
  The Philippines must devalue the peso if
  it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning
  Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.
      ""The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports
  more competitive,"" Monsod said an interview. ""No question about
  it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South
  Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies
  deliberately undervalued their currencies.""
      The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is
  currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.
      Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does
  not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and
  able to continue to respond to market conditions.
      Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from
  the point of view of finance. ""If the dollar rate goes higher,
  our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the
  financing is very difficult,"" she said. ""But I am looking at it
  in terms of the economy.""
      She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.
      ""I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to
  become uncompetitive because then we are dead.""
      Monsod said, ""The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is
  a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates)
  of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic
  thing.""
      Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct
  in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was
  expected to touch five pct this year.
      He said the government and the International Monetary Fund
  had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.
      The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the
  dollar when it was floated in 1984.

"PIER 1 IMPORTS &lt;PIR> AMENDING DATES ON SPLIT
  Pier 1 Imports Inc said it
  amended its record and distribution dates for its previously-

  split.
      The split common and 25 cts preferred shares will be
  distributed on July 2, 1987, to shareholders of record June 24,

  25 mln and an increase of authorized shares of preferred stock
  to five mln from one mln, the company said.
      The change in the dates was based on the company's desire
  to have the additional common and 25 cts preferred shares trade
  for the shortest practical period of time on a ""when issued""

"PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER
  Pakistan is not emerging as a major
  wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough,
  Sartaj Aziz, Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the
  Pakistani Prime Minister, said in an interview.
      No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and
  plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing
  because they could not agree a price, he said.
      Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses
  of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few
  harvests in years when the weather is favourable.
      The government does not wish to increase output much above
  this because of low world prices, and the land would be better
  used for other crops.
      Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown
  to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some
  10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to
  more profitable crops such as oilseeds.
      The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the
  current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha
  over the next five to seven years, he said.
      Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop, harvesting of which is
  just beginning, is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln
  tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year's
  yield of 14.0 mln.
      He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more
  recent rains reduced prospects slightly.
      The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln
  tonnes by mid-1993, taking into account Pakistan's annual
  population growth rate of more than three pct. Current
  consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.
      The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes, Aziz said.
  This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln
  tonnes, which Pakistan will maintain at all costs, and a
  ""strategic reserve"" target of two mln tonnes.
      Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over
  target, the surplus will not be exported at present, he said.
      The government wants to keep an extra ""safety margin"" until
  it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat
  rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports
  will be considered only in about a year's time when the 1987/88
  crop can be gauged as well, he said.
      The new domestic policy, introduced on March 15, is for the
  government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two
  rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in
  Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.
      Under the old system, introduced during World War Two and
  due to be phased out by April 15, some 50 mln ration cards were
  issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.
      Aziz said following the introduction of a government
  support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that
  only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the
  consumer, the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.
      The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect
  on the internal wheat market that was intended, Aziz said.
      Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of
  the new system. The wheat price in Karachi, the most expensive
  Pakistani city, had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March
  1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.
      Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a
  major effect on total consumption, but it may encourage better
  use of side-products such as bran.

"MONETARY AUTHORITIES SAID TO LOSE CREDIBILITY
  The monetary authorities of the major
  industrialised countries lost their credibility this week as
  the dollar was sold off despite pleas from ministers and
  widespread central bank intervention, dealers said.
      The dollar's fall below 150 yen, which follows last month's
  Paris currency stabilisation agreement by the U.S., Japan, West
  Germany, Britain, France and Canada, is a dramatic reversal of
  the success of the Group of Five (G-5) 1985 New York Plaza
  meeting to weaken the dollar, they said.
      The G-5 and the market agreed in 1985 that the dollar was
  overvalued but this time the market and the authorities are on
  different sides, dealers said.
      Apparent confusion in the ranks of the G-5 nations has
  encouraged the market to challenge the authorities despite
  concerted intervention by the central banks of the United
  States, Japan, Britain and West Germany, they said.
      Pleas by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa for
  action to stabilise the dollar were matched over the weekend by
  comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that there was
  no target zone for the dollar. The dollar was sold anyway.
      Yesterday's comment by Baker that he stood by the Paris
  accord did nothing to reverse sentiment, dealers said.
      The intervention, backed by remarks by Fed Chairman Paul
  Volcker and Japanese central bank governor Satoshi Sumita,
  which a few months ago would have brought the dollar fall to a
  halt, has done little but slow the rate of its decline, they
  noted.
      The situation has again raised the question of whether
  intervention can succeed against the trend in today's huge
  currency markets. Dealers said the market's cool response to
  intervention reflected a basic oversupply of dollars.
      ""This means that the current dollar selling is not of a
  sheer speculative nature but backed by real demand,"" said Koichi
  Miyazaki, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank.
      Dealers said the dollar will remain weak despite the
  intervention and it is only a matter of time before some
  operators try to push it below 148 yen. The dollar closed in
  Tokyo today at 149.40 against New York's 149.30/40. Its record
  low was 148.40 in Tokyo last Tuesday.
      Dealers said the dollar will gain only temporary support to
  rise above 150 yen toward early April when the Group of Seven
  industrial nations meets to discuss currencies again.
      The market expects the seven nations (the Paris six plus
  Italy) to try to agree on another way to stabilise currencies
  apart from intervention, a chief dealer at a U.S. Bank said.
      Dealers said they were unsure what other methods could be
  used and they are sceptical anyway about how long the Paris
  accord nations, particulary the U.S., Will remain willing to
  prevent a further dollar fall given the continuing high U.S.
  Trade deficit, especially with Japan.
      Further pressure from a protectionist U.S. Congress for a
  lower dollar is also limiting Washington's options, they said.
      The market now thinks the central bank action is to slow
  the dollar fall, not to push it back over 150 yen, said
  Tadahiko Nashimoto, manager at Long Term Credit Bank of Japan.
      Another bearish factor for the dollar is expected large
  forward dollar sales from April to June for export bills
  falling due for Japanese exporters from April to September.
      The exporters had delayed in expectation of a further yen
  depreciation, dealers said.
      Yesterday's request to 30 trading houses by the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry to restrict dollar sales looks
  ineffective in light of this real demand, they said.
      The market is also anticipating active institutional dollar
  sales to hedge currency risks on bond holdings from the new
  business year starting April 1, dealers said.
      ""The market seems to have established a new dollar trading
  range between 147 and 149 yen,"" one dealer said.
      The dollar traded between 151 and 153 yen after the Paris
  accord on February 22 and 150 yen was then considered the low
  end for the dollar against the yen, he said.
      Some dealers now believe that if the dollar falls below 148
  yen, it will pick up renewed downward momentum and slide to
  145.

"GALACTIC &lt;GALCF> ADOPTS CONSERVATIVE ACCOUNTING
  Galactic Resources
  Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said
  it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to
  other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs.
      As a result, the company retroactively charged all past
  exploration and related administration costs incurred on its
  properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.
      Under the new policy, all future exploration and related
  administration costs will be written off to expenses rather
  than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.
      Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln
  U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately
  disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.
      The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely
  affect working capital position, future cash flows or the
  company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it
  said.
      Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of
  costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln
  U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other
  mine developments.
      Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the
  Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the
  life of the mine and charged against future earnings.
      The change will also result in lower depreciation and
  amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an
  ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total
  estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.
      Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is
  expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent
  production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000
  ounces.

"U.S. BANKER PREDICTS FURTHER DOLLAR FALL THIS YEAR
  A leading U.S. Banker said the dollar
  was likely to fall another five to 10 pct this year and an
  improvement in the huge American trade deficit would be only
  temporary at current world exchange rate levels.
      Kurt Viermetz, Worldwide Treasurer of &lt;Morgan Guaranty
  Trust Co>, told Arab currency traders meeting here that the
  steady depreciation of the dollar had not gone far enough to
  rein in U.S. Deficits on a lasting basis.
      Speaking at the 14th annual congress of the Interarab
  Cambist Association, Viermetz said an agreement reached last
  month among major industrial nations to steady the dollar
  around current levels left many questions unanswered.
      ""I cannot see any chance for a real turnaround (rise) in the
  dollar,"" Viermetz said. ""I believe there is room for a further
  fall of five to 10 per cent in 1987.""
      The United States, West Germany, Japan, France, Great
  Britain and Canada -- G-6 -- agreed in Paris in late February
  to stabilise major currencies around current levels.
      The accord came after months of transatlantic argument,
  with Tokyo and Bonn claiming Washington's policy of talking the
  dollar lower had made life impossible for West German and
  Japanese exporters.
      The Paris accord also brought a pause to the continued
  slide of the dollar engineered by a meeting in New York in
  September 1985 when industrial nations agreed to depress the
  value of the currency to help redress global trade imbalances.
      But Viermetz said Morgan Guaranty's economic models showed
  that with no further change in exchange rates -- and continued
  sluggish growth in West Germany and Japan -- the U.S. Trade
  deficit would improve only temporarily.
      He said the deficit might fall to 145 billion dlrs this
  year from 165 billion in 1986 and further improve to 120
  billion in 1988 but by 1990, it would be back around 160
  billion dlrs.
      ""This is clearly unacceptable for the monetary authorities
  and politicians in Washington,"" he said.
      Viermetz said it was only natural that markets should
  attempt to test the credibility of the Paris accord, struck
  when the dollar was trading at about 1.83 marks and 152.50 yen.
      Immediately before the historic 1985 New York agreement or
  ""Plaza Accord,"" the dollar had been trading at 2.84 marks and 240
  yen.
      Viermetz said he believed major nations in Paris wanted to
  see the dollar hold within a ""loose range"" of 1.75 to 1.90 marks
  and 145 to 155 yen, with any attempt to push the U.S. Currency
  lower being countered by central bank intervention.
      The dollar ended in New York yesterday at 147.15/25 yen --
  its lowest level against the Japanese currency in roughly 40
  years. It closed at 1.8160/70 marks.
      Viermetz also said he did not see the U.S. Federal funds
  rate falling below six pct for fear of provoking an
  uncontrolled fall in the dollar.
      But at the same time, worries about the international debt
  crisis would mean there was little chance of a rise above 6-3/4
  pct since this would increase loan costs to the third world.
      The Middle East foreign exchange conference brings together
  more than 200 traders and bank treasury chiefs from the Arab
  world and Arab banks in European and U.S. Financial centres.
      Formal discussions, which end today, have also centred on
  the role of Arab banks in world financial markets, with bankers
  urging them to adapt to a new global trend towards
  securitisation of  business.
      Hikmat Nashashibi, President of the Arab Bankers
  Association, said Arab banks have to shake off their old
  mentality of commercial banking and concentrate more on
  investment banking.

"E.C. OFFICIAL SAYS FATE OF VEG OIL TAX UNCERTAIN
  Whether the European Community's
  Council of Ministers will approve a proposed tax on vegetable
  oils that has sparked threats of U.S. retaliation is uncertain,
  an EC official said.
      ""It is very far from certain that it will go through,"" Sir
  Roy Denman, Head of the EC Delegation in Washington, told
  reporters before he addressed the Foreign Trade Association.
      Denman noted Britain remains opposed to the plan and West
  Germany has opposed it in the past.
      U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter has threatened
  retaliation if the tax is approved, as it would limit U.S.
  soybean exports to the EC. Council action is expected soon.
      Denman said while the EC is willing to negotiate about
  agriculture in a new round of trade talks, it is unwilling to
  single out export subsidies on a negotiating agenda or put
  agricultural policy on a special fast track.
      ""The key to a solution in this area seems to me not in the
  framing of the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
  wording...but in tackling government subsidies to farmers on
  both sides of the Atlantic,"" he said.

"FRENCH INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION FALLS IN JANUARY
  French industrial production fell a
  seasonally adjusted 1.98 pct in January after revised unchanged
  output in December, the National Statistics Institute (INSEE)
  said.
      The figure, which excludes construction and public works,
  put the January index, base 1980, at 99 after 101 in December.
  January output was 1.98 pct down on January 1986.
      INSEE, which from January changed its base year to 1980
  from 1970, originally had December output down 2.2 pct on
  November, using the old base year.
      INSEE said production in January was affected by rail
  strikes and severely cold weather.
      It said output of gas and electricity was very high but
  activity slowed on construction sites, in quarries and in
  certain base industries.

"U.K. VISIBLE TRADE DEFICIT NARROWS IN FEBRUARY
  Britain's visible trade deficit narrowed
  to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February
  from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department
  said.
      The current account balance of payments in February showed
  a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
  compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.
      Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln
  surplus, the same as in January.
      Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16
  billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a
  record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.
      Trade Department officials said the improvement in
  Britain's current account contrasted with most private
  forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
  rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
  expected.
      The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January
  reduced exports that month and that there had been an element
  of catching up in the February figures.
      The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to
  underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from
  114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.

      The index for materials and fuel purchased by manufacturing

  pct fall in February.
      The Department said the year-on-year rise in producer

  provisional 4.2 pct increase in the year to end-February.
      The index for output prices, non-seasonally adjusted, was

  was set at 128.2 in March after February's 129.6.
      The 1.1 pct fall in input prices between February and March
  was mainly due to a seasonal fall in industrial electricity
  costs and lower scheduled prices for petroleum products, the
  Department said.
      The Department said these falls were only partly offset by
  a rise in prices of home-produced food manufacturing materials.

"LITTLE RISK SEEN FOR TEXAS COTTON FROM COLD
  Texas' cotton crop stands little
  chance of damage from frigid temperatures expected tonight in
  that state, as very little cotton has been planted, according
  to Texas agricultural sources and cotton market analysts.
      ""It's still pretty early for cotton planting. Only six pct
  of the crop was planted as of last week,"" said Doug Stillmann,
  a statistician at the Texas Agricultural Statistic Service in
  Austin, a division of the U.S. Agriculture Department.
      Stillmann and other cotton market sources said planting had
  begun in the Rio Grande Valley and South Texas areas only, with
  planting in the crucial high and low plains areas not slated to
  begin until next month. The high and low plains accounted for
  60 pct of the 2.5 mln bales produced in Texas last year,
  Stillmann said.
      Temperatures tonight in most of Texas are expected to drop
  to freezing to the low 20s, although the lower Rio Grande
  Valley may see more moderate readings in the middle 30s,
  according to meteorologists at Accu-Weather Inc.

      Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
  showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
  weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average,
  and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.
      The company was commenting in a statement on its 1986
  results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable
  profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
  Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
      RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range
  of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
  oil prices.
      Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
  profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
  the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned

"GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER
  One of General Electric Co's biggest
  businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing
  profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,
  Wall Street analysts said.
      Previously, it was expected the business would peak and
  decline at some point in the next five years. The improved
  outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new
  planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.
      ""Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,"" said
  Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
      AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements
  for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>
  twinjet long distance aircraft.
      But AMR said it was using ""rent-a-plane leases"" that allow
  it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
  structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the
  planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects
  AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
  downturn in the economy.
      From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal
  for several reasons, Heymann said.
      GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
  delivery, Heymann noted.
      And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes
  GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,
  would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
  wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal
  appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.
      GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
  midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
  and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company ""no one
  order will have much of an effect on the stock.""
      Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the
  order ""will help to maintain a good level of production and
  profitability in the aircraft engine business"" for GE.
      Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine
  business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
  by 1991.
      Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
  year, with well over half of the business in the military
  sector, according to analysts' estimates.
      The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides
  with an upbeat performance in other segments.
      Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
  quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,
  he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp
  that it has a ""unique ability"" to buy a major business and
  reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
  elements of its 14 business areas.
      Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current
  quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the
  NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.
      Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part
  crediting ""significant benefits from the RCA acquisition.""

      The rise follows a year-on-year increase in December 1986

  January 1986.
      Istat said there were 20 working days in January, the same
  as December, but one fewer than January last year.
      Istat said the year-on-year fall reflected poorer
  performances in the footwear, clothing, textiles, chemicals and
  metals industries.
      It said office machinery and data sectors, wood and
  furniture, precision mechanics, oil and electricity showed
  improved activity.

"PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SEES STRONGER COPPER PRICES
  Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good
  fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices
  for the metal.
      In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham
  said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices
  up eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last
  month.
      ""Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates
  of our trucks,"" he said, referring to tightness of supply and
  strong demand. ""The fundamentals are good.""
     
      Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said;
  ""All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored.""
      He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for
  almost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on
  record behind 1984, he said.
      Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with
  annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.
     
      During the interview, executive vice president Douglas
  Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before
  the copper price rose ""because there aren't that many new
  projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
  will continue to grow modestly.""
      Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to
  more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound
  rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for
  Phelps Dodge, the company said.
      ""Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction
  and other areas,"" Yearley said.
     
      New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine
  owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's
  &lt;BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's
  own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production
  shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.
      Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located
  Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production
  at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The

"LITTLE REACTION TO REMOVAL COMEX DAILY LIMITS
  The elimination of limits on daily price
  fluctuations for metals futures contracts traded on the
  Commodity Exchange, COMEX, appears to be having little effect
  on the market, analysts said.
      ""There is nothing apparent from the change,"" said William
  O'Neill, director of futures research at Elders Futures Inc.
      ""The market has not approached the old price limits and
  trading is relative quiet, in narrow ranges,"" he said.
      On May 5, COMEX eliminated price limits on the two
  contracts following each spot delivery in gold, silver, copper
  and aluminum futures after a review of its clearing operations,
  which were severely tested by a volatile market in silver
  futures at the end of April. COMEX announced Friday the lifting
  of all daily limits, effective today.
      Gold futures, which previously had a limit of 25 dlrs per
  ounce in most back months, were about 7.00 dlrs weaker in the
  nearby contracts amid thin volume conditions, traders said.
      Silver futures, previously limited at 50 cents in most back
  months, were trading about 30-40 cts weaker in the nearby
  contracts amid quiet trading today.
      During the last week of April, silver futures often traded
  at the daily allowable limit amid concerns about inflation, the
  dollar, and other factors. Traders rushed into the spot, or
  unlimited, contract to offset those moves, analysts said.
      As a result, O'Neill said, there was much confusion, many
  unmatched trades, and large losses for some traders.
      The COMEX fined four large firms a total of 100,000 dlrs
  for failure to resolve unmatched trades in a timely manner.
      Paul Cain, a vice president at Shearson Lehman Brothers,
  said the elimination of price limits will cut back on panic
  buying or selling and contribute to more orderly markets.
      O'Neill added that the elimination of daily limits would
  add caution to trading.
      ""This is a more realistic approach because the metals
  market is a 24 hours market and prices can move without limit,""
  O'Neill said.

"ICO COFFEE PRODUCERS TO DISCUSS MARKET SITUATION
  International Coffee Organization, ICO,
  producers will meet at 1500 GMT (0900 est) for a general
  discussion of the market situation, producer spokesman
  Lindenberg Sette said.
      The Brazilian delegate said several producers requested the
  meeting but Brazil was not among them. The ICO executive
  board's regular session this week has so far been confined to
  routine matters, with no attempt by producers or consumers to
  revive export quota negotiations, delegates said.
      Talks to restore quotas collapsed early last month when
  producers and consumers failed to resolve differences on how
  quotas should be allocated.
      Producer delegates said there was no sense of urgency among
  producers to reopen quota talks with consumers, with most
  countries now prepared to wait for the ICO's annual September
  council session to restart negotiations.
      Members of the Inter-African Coffee Organization called for
  today's producer meeting to exchange views on the market
  situation, the producer delegates said.
      The lack of a new debate on export quotas here this week
  was cited as the reason for renewed weakness in coffee prices
  in London and New York futures, traders said.
      Near May in London hit a five-year low this morning at
  1,220 stg, about 50 stg below last night's close, they said.
      The executive board session looks set to end today,
  following a final session at 1600 GMT (1000 est) when a
  consultancy report of the operation of the ICO will be
  presented to producers and consumers, delegates added.

"INSTITUTES DIVIDED ON OUTLOOK FOR GERMAN ECONOMY
  The five leading West German economic
  research institutes have failed to agree about how strongly the
  domestic economy will expand this year but revised down
  forecasts contained in a report published six months ago.
      The three research groups of Kiel, Hamburg and Essen
  predicted in the institutes' joint spring report that gross
  national product (GNP) would rise by two pct in 1987, compared
  with 2.4 pct in 1986. The five institutes had jointly forecast
  three pct 1987 growth in October last year.
      Taking a dissenting view, the DIW institute of West Berlin
  and Munich's Ifo institute predicted only one pct 1987 growth.
      The joint report said that the estimates of economic
  development made by the DIW and Ifo were ""markedly less
  favourable"" than those of the other three.
      The DIW and Ifo forecast the economy would pick up after a
  slow start to the year. ""In the second half of 1987 there will,
  however, only be a weak upward movement,"" they said.
      The two institutes said external economic factors which
  were currently damaging exports and pushing up imports would
  dominate the economic environment throughout the year. They saw
  exports falling by a real 2-1/2 pct in 1987 and predicted no
  marked improvement in the course of the year.
      The other three institutes, however, wrote: ""The decline in
  demand and production (seen) in the winter months does not
  indicate the beginning of a cyclical downswing.""
      They said the sharp rise of the mark had led to corporate
  uncertainty and companies had not carried out investment plans.
  But they expected that many investments had not been cancelled
  but only put off. ""It can be presumed that the braking actions
  (on the economy) will diminish markedly this year.""
      They added: ""The domestic prerequisites for a continuation
  of the economic uptrend are still favourable.""
      These three institutes said diminishing external burdens
  combined with favourable domestic conditions meant an upturn in
  demand and production could be expected by the spring.
      However, this projection was clouded by risks including the
  further development of the mark against the dollar.
      Contrary to the DIW and Ifo, the three institutes said that
  while exports would continue to be the weak point of the
  economy in 1987, ""there is good reason to believe that exports
  will soon bottom out and that a slight rise will emerge during
  the course of the year."" They predicted an overall 0.5 pct fall
  in exports in 1987, the same as in 1986.
      The three more positive institutes saw private consumption
  rising by four pct in 1987, compared with 4.2 pct in 1986,
  while DIW and Ifo predicted a three pct increase.
      They saw the climate for equipment investment improving but
  predicted only a rise of four pct in 1987 against 4.6 pct in
  1986. Ifo and DIW saw these investments rising by only two pct.
      All the institutes predicted only a slight decline in
  unemployment. The Kiel, Hamburg and Essen institutes said the
  jobless total would average 2.17 mln in 1987 compared with 2.23
  mln in 1986 and predicted a rise in the number of people in
  work of about 200,000.
      These three institutes said new jobs would be created
  mainly in the private services sector and also by the state in
  the context of job creation measures. The construction industry
  was likely to engage new workers for the first time since 1980
  but they predicted either no rise in employment in the
  manufactured goods industry or only a slight expansion.
      The DIW and Ifo said rises in employment would occur only
  in the tertiary sector, while ""the number employed in the
  manufacturing industry will decline.""
      The DIW and Ifo said unemployment would only decline to
  2.20 mln in 1987 from 2.23 mln in 1986.
      They saw the current account surplus falling in 1987 to 58
  billion marks from 78 billion in 1986. The other three saw a
  current account surplus in 1987 of at least 60 billion marks
  and predicted that the trade surplus would fall to only around
  100 billion marks from 112 billion in 1986.
      The institutes agreed that consumer prices would start to
  rise in 1987, after they declined in 1986, and all five
  predicted an average increase over the year of 0.5 pct.

"DUTCH PORT EMPLOYERS RESUME LAY-OFF PLANS
  Employers in Rotterdam's troubled
  general cargo sector have decided to restart stalled redundancy
  procedures within a week, employers' organisation labour
  relations manager Gerard Zeebregts told Reuters.
      Port and transport union spokesman Bert Duim said the
  employers' decision would not lead to the immediate resumption
  of eight weeks of strikes in the sector.
      The strike action was called off on Friday after an interim
  court injunction against the employers' plans for 350
  redundancies this year.
      A court in Amsterdam ruled last week the employers had made
  an error in the complicated procedure for obtaining permission
  for the redundancies and therefore could not proceed until a
  final ruling on May 7.
      Zeebregts said the initiation of new procedure might well
  take up to two months, but the employers were not prepared
  simply to sit and wait for the May 7 court ruling with the
  chance they would have to start all over again in any case.
      ""We cannot afford not to continue with our plans. The
  strikes have already cost a lot of money and damaged business,
  and further delays would do even more damage,"" Zeebregts said.
      The campaign of lightning strikes in the port's general
  cargo sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' plans
  for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 strong workforce
  by 1990, starting with 350 this year.

"DOUBTS ABOUT ACCORD SEEN WEAKENING DOLLAR FURTHER
  The dollar is expected to decline further
  in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of
  last month's Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates,
  senior foreign exchange dealers said.
      Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers
  said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of
  147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down.
  Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month's
  accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the
  dollar down, the dealers said.
      ""The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
  that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major
  currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,"" said Koji
  Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd's treasury
  division.
      He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S.
  Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of
  intervening to support the currency.
      ""This eliminated the widespread market caution against
  possible joint central bank intervention,"" Kidokoro said.
      Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward
  momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly
  contain a further slide in the currency.
      They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5
  billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers,
  and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars
  through the U.S. Central bank in New York.
      Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve
  would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but
  some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148
  yen.
      ""If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the
  flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the
  Americans don't want,"" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market
  manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.
      He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month
  when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close
  their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.
      But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar
  remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of
  the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and
  Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.
      ""The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan's inertia in
  stimulating its economy,"" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant
  general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd's international
  treasury division.
      In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of
  economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to
  boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its
  trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on
  the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of
  parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a
  sales tax.
      In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance
  of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future,
  Dai-Ichi Kangyo's Tanaka said.
      Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the
  Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress
  would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.

      Both analysts said the rise in Standard's price this
  morning to above the proposed tender price of 70 dlrs a share,
  is an indication that investors expect the bid to be sweetened.
  Standard gained 6-3/4 to 71-5/8.
      The analysts cited Royal Dutch/Shell Group's &lt;RD> &lt;SC> bid
  for Shell Oil Co, which was sweetened before its successful
  conclusion.

"SIEMENS REBUTTS U.S. CRITICISM ON CGCT OFFER

  Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and Telegraph
  Corp's &lt;T.N>, AT and T, entry into French telecommunications
  firm &lt;Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques>, CGCT.
      Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the
  acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and
  Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decided
  on two years ago as claimed by AT and T.
      The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens
  at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.
  The result of the negotiations was still open.
      Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.
      The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman
  James E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and T
  and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the
  U.S.
      Baur said he expected the French government to decide on
  the winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the French
  switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.
      The French government has limited CGCT participation by
  foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs
  for the whole company.
      Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the
  initial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later but
  said Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology.
      Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm
  &lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start of
  March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will
  form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.
     Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while
  Jeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mln

"HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES
  Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a
  statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a
  fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.
      The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and
  other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure
  on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of
  crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of
  polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.
      World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in
  1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01
  billion from 42.72 billion.
      Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion
  marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.
      The statement made no mention of net profit figures.
  Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.
      In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the
  cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues
  at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the
  previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from
  1986, Hoechst said.
      Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information
  technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.
      Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of
  the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to
  &lt;American Hoechst Corp>.
      Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the
  restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.
      Roussel Uclaf &lt;RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated
  partners did not perform as well as in 1985.
      Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax
  profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings
  from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in
  extraordinary costs.
      The fall in raw material prices was not enough to
  compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and
  currencies, Hoechst said.
      The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new
  projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital
  increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the
  acquisition of &lt;Celanese Corp>.
      Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to
  form &lt;Hoechst Celanese Corp>.

"TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986
  Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments
  deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking
  steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali
  Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning
  Organisation said.
      He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of
  economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985,
  which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.
      Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a
  drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury
  wholesale index last year.
      This year's target of 20 pct ""might be attainable but the
  economic management will have to be careful,"" he said.
      Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme
  which is central to the government's economic planning, said
  Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account
  shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.
      ""We must alleviate the current account substantially to
  sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure
  over the last five years,"" he added.
      His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic
  Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said
  Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms
  would look better if inflation were lower and the current
  account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.
      ""In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector
  investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a
  percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible
  improvement in the current account deficit,"" he said.
      Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was
  also to blame for the high deficits.
      Appropriations to government departments had been cut by
  eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign
  borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.
      ""We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the
  investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations,"" he
  said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing
  requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated
  5.6 pct in 1986.
      More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also
  targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage
  exports, and production incentives were being considered.
      ""We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected
  into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion
  policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and
  local private capital come more into play as far as
  manufacturing capacity is concerned,"" Tigrel said.
      He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish
  economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under
  way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate
  policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done
  in a country where the state still dominates industry and the
  currency is only partially convertible.

      The company said the study found proven ore reserves of
  3,302,000 short tons grading 0.077 ounce of gold per ton. It
  said the mine will operate at a rate of 626,000 tons of ore per
  year, with higher-grade ore being mined in the first three
  years for a rapid payback of capital costs.
      It said the feasibility study calls for gold production
  averaging 41,000 ounces a year for the life of the mine and
  50,000 ounces a year over the first three years, with 99,000
  ounces of silver per year being produced over the mine life.
      Capital costs would be 22.3 mln dlrs with all-new equipment
  and 500,000 to one mln dlrs less with used equipment, the firm
  said. It said the mine would be operated by a contract miner
  but the associated mill by Geodome.
      Geodome said a new ore zone discovered last summer is not
  included in reserve calculations. It said eight of the nine
  holes drilled there have an average grade of 0.046 ounce of
  gold and 2.1 ounces of silver per ton.
      Also excluded are reserves of 1,400,000 tons of low-grade
  material that could be milled profitably at 425 dlrs a ton for
  gold. The feasibility study used a 350 dlr gold price.
      Geodome said operating costs of the mine will average 201
  dlr per ounce of gold for the mine life and 171 dlrs for the
  first three years, in constant dollars.

"UAE TRADE, CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUSES NARROW
  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) recorded
  a 1986 trade surplus of 12.2 billion dirhams, narrowing from
  30.2 billion in 1985, the central bank's latest bulletin shows.
      The central bank said the lower surplus was mainly due to
  the decline in the value of exports and reexports to 37.2
  billion dirhams from 54.2 billion in 1985. This reflected the
  decline in oil prices last year and difficulties in marketing
  UAE oil, the central bank added.
      The surplus on the current account narrowed to 6.8 billion
  dirhams from 25.5 billion in 1985. The overall balance showed a
  surplus of 4.8 billion after 2.6 billion in 1985.

"COFFEE FALL NOT SEEN AFFECTING COLOMBIA'S DEBT
  The sharp fall in international coffee
  prices will not affect Colombia's external credit situation,
  finance minister Cesar Gaviria told reuters.
      He said the current depression on world coffee markets was
  not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on
  Colombia's financial state which he described as sound.
      ""Our foreign debt is high, but we can pay and I hope the
  foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us,""
  he said.
      Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have
  rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt
  of 13.6 billion dlrs.
      Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week
  from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade
  union following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lower
  coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs
  in revenues for 1987.
      Gaviria submitted to the world bank and the inter-american
  bank last week in new york a borrowing plan, for a total of
  3.054 billion dlrs to be disbursed over the next four years,
  which he said was approved.

"TRADERS DETAIL FRENCH CEREAL EXPORT REQUESTS
  French operators last Friday requested
  licences to export 10,500 tonnes of free market maize, 11,950
  tonnes of free market barley and 13,000 of soft wheat flour to
  non-EC countries, at prefixed daily (droit commun) rebates,
  French trade sources said.
      The latest requests for the maize were for export to
  Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate
  prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20
  Ecu daily rebate.
      The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context
  of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the
  export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries,
  in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent
  dispute over grain sales to Spain.
      If the latest French requests are accepted as expected,
  this will bring the total of French maize exported in this
  context to 25,500 tonnes.
      The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the
  sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.
      Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria
  and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed
  restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat
  flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an

"NEW VENEZUELA DEBT INTEREST RATE GOES INTO EFFECT
  The new interest rate of 7/8 pct over
  Libor on Venezuelan public sector debt payments goes into
  effect today, Finance Minister Manuel Azpurua said .
      Azpurua told reporters yesterday the reduction from the
  previous margin of 1-1/8 pct above Libor will save the country
  some 50 mln dollars in debt servicing.
      The new rate is among changes agreed last month to the 20.3
  billion dlr public sector debt rescheduling. Under the new
  agreement, Venezula was also able to extend the term from 12 to
  14 years and to lower debt payments in the 1987-89 period by 64
  pct.
      Azpurua said that according to the agreement, the new
  interest rate will be retroactive to April 1, provided the
  accord is approved before October 1.
      He told reporters the term sheet detailing the changes in
  the rescheduling has already been endorsed by the 13-member

      The new agreement replaces a rescheduling accord signed in

"HOUSE PANEL WANTS PENTAGON MANAGE U.S. STOCKPILE
  The House Armed Services Committee
  has voted for a transfer in the management of stockpiled
  materials for national defense to the U.S. Defense Secretary.
      The committee also voted for legally-binding quantity and
  quality requirements on the materials, mostly metals.
      The measures are a part of the Defense Authorization Bill
  which will be voted on in the House next month.
      The purpose of the measures, passed by the committee
  yesterday, is to improve stockpile management and discourage
  sell-offs of materials that could jeopardize strategic needs, a
  staff member of the committee told Reuters.
      ""They (the stockpiles) stand to gain the most by being
  managed properly,"" said the staffer. ""Management of the stockpile
  over the last 10 years has been atrocious.""
      Responsibility for stockpile management now belongs to a
  White House agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      The staffer said that under the measures passed by the
  committee the Secretary of Defense would have more influence
  over decisions to keep or sell strategic stockpile materials.
      The administration has proposed a goal of 700 million dlrs
  worth of strategic materials to be held in the stockpile. The
  stockpile now contains around 10 billion dlrs of materials.
      He said several agencies currently helped FEMA to manage
  the stockpile and decide how much to sell to help the deficit.
      These agencies included the Office of Management and Budget
  and the Departments of Interior and Commerce, he said.
      The committee believed the shared involvement in stockpile
  management was counter-productive, he said.

"PORTUGUESE GRAIN AGENCY BAN OPPOSED BY MINISTER
  Portugal's Agriculture Minister Alvaro
  Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state
  grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import
  tenders open to private traders.
      Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted
  to the tenders.
      Under the terms of Portugal's January 1986 accession to the
  European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC
  (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced
  by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.
      Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon's
  civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month
  that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done,
  in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.
      As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March
  12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.
      Barreto said, ""My objective is put EPAC into the tenders
  because it has a right to take part."" He added the government
  would be studying the court order to see whether or not the
  ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.
      Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator,
  whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders
  had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the
  Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.
      ""There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,""
  Barreto said. He said the EC's executive commission had
  accepted the government's view that EPAC should be eligible.
      The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC's participation in
  the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the
  clauses of Portugal's EC accession treaty dealing with the
  gradual dismantling of the state agency's import monopoly.

"HUGHES TOOL DIRECTORS REJECT MERGER WITH BAKER
  The directors of Hughes Tool Co
  &lt;HT> said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject
  a merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO> today.
      Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation
  would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M.
  Local time (1600 GMT) to discuss the proposed merger.
      Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger
  but decided against it.
      The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice
  requirement that Baker sell off several specialised
  subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling.
      The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel
  the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement.
      The board of directors of the California-based Baker had
  approved the merger. On February 17 Baker said it had signed an
  agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries.
      The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with
  the Justice Department requirement, Kerridge said.

  The Federal Trade Commission said it
  eased a requirement that Allied-Signal Inc's Allied Corp
  subsidiary get prior FTC approval before making certain
  acquisitions in the high-purity acid market.
      The FTC said it ended the prior approval requirement
  because Allied no longer has businesses covered by the order.
  Other restrictions still apply, it said.
      The restrcitions stem from a 1983 order by the FTC settling

"GULF ARAB STATES MOVE TOWARDS ECONOMIC INTEGRATION
  Finance and economy ministers of the
  six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have ended talks
  after adopting resolutions and recommendations aimed at
  boosting economic integration.
      But the ministers from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
  Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) did not endorse a
  resolution on a common currency exchange rate system.
      The UAE's Minister of State for Finance and Industry, Ahmed
  Humaid al-Tayer, told reporters after the two-day talks that
  the ministers referred the issue back to GCC central bank
  governors for further discussion.
      He said the governors, who agreed in January on a proposed
  denominator on which the six currencies should be based, were
  asked to resubmit the recommendation before July, when finance
  ministers were due to meet in Saudi Arabia.
      Bankers said the central bank governors would meet soon to
  discuss the issue, adding there was a possibility that a new
  system could be submitted for final approval to a GCC summit
  conference scheduled to be held in Saudi Arabia late this year.
      The denominator approved by the governors has not been made
  public, but banking sources said it could be similar to the
  European Monetary System (EMS).
      Tayer said the ministers agreed in principle to allow GCC
  citizens to set up businesses and work in any member state.
  They also agreed in principle on a recommendation for citizens
  to buy and own shares of GCC shareholding firms.
      He said the ministers discussed a report on imported goods
  containing radiation caused by last year's Chernobyl nuclear
  disaster in the Soviet Union, and agreed all products with
  excessive levels should be returned to the country of origin.

"CHINA POSTPONES PLAN TO SCRAP PARALLEL CURRENCY
  Chinese Vice-Premier Tian Jiyun said
  plans to scrap the country's parallel currency, Foreign
  Exchange Certificates (FECs), had been postponed due to
  objections from foreign businessmen and others.
      But Tian told a news conference the Chinese government
  still considered FECs unsatisfactory.
      Asked about the current state of plans to abolish the FECs,
  Tian said: ""We have decided to postpone the question. As to
  whether it will be done in the future, it will be done
  according to the evolution of the situation.""
      He said many people, including foreign businessmen, had
  raised objections to the plan to abolish the certificates, and
  added: ""It is rather complicated.""
      The FECs were introduced in 1980 for use by foreigners in
  China. But they now circulate widely among local residents and
  there is a big black market in the currency, though it is
  theoretically at par with the ordinary Chinese currency,
  renminbi.
      Tian said the government still considered that the FECs had
  ""many demerits and negative influences.""
      Bank of China President Wang Deyan told Reuters earlier
  this month that he thought it unlikely that the certificates
  would be scrapped this year.
      Western diplomats and economists have said the Chinese
  authorities are having trouble finding a suitable alternative.
      Vice-Premier Yao Yilin announced at a similar press
  conference last year that the FECs would be abolished, saying
  the government had decided it was ideologically unacceptable to
  have two currencies circulating in China at the same time.
