"JAPAN ASKS TRADERS, EXPORTERS TO CUT DOLLAR SALES
  The Ministry of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI) has asked about 30 Japanese trading houses and
  exporters to refrain from excessive dollar selling, trading
  house officials said.
      The officials told Reuters MITI asked them to moderate
  their foreign exchange trading because the excessive rise in
  the yen will have unfavourable effects on the economy. It made
  the request by telephone.
      A MITI official said the ministry has conducted a survey of
  foreign exchange trading by trade houses and exporters. But he
  said it was not aimed at moderating dollar selling.
      The trading house officials said MITI had asked them to
  undertake foreign exchange transactions with due consideration
  to the adverse effects excessive exchange rate movements would
  have on the economy.
      The MITI official said MITI undertakes such surveys when
  exchange rates fluctuate widely. A similiar survey was made
  when the currency fell to the previous record low of 149.98 on
  January 19. It hit a new record low of 148.20 yen yesterday.
      He said the survey showed currency transactions by trade
  houses and exporters contributed little to the dollar fall.

"TALKING POINT/WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL &lt;WEN>
  Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's
  International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the
  fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested
  suitor.
      Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost
  a point when Coca Cola &lt;KO> said the rumors were untrue.
  However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more
  than three mln shares.
      Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they
  said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food
  restaurant chain was impossible.
      Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.
  Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a
  Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor
  and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.
      Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc &lt;BUD> and
  Pepsico Inc &lt;PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither
  of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's
  official.
      ""It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but
  its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,"" said
  Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.
      However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the
  current market rumors.
      Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been
  skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it
  views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become
  a competitor to them.
      ""I can't put another name on it,"" said Kidder peabody
  analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up
  Wendy's stock. ""It very well could be someone's interested.""
      But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time
  for Wendy's to be sold.
      ""They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've
  always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an
  offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the
  right time,"" Freedman said.
      ""If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control
  the situation,"" Freedman said.
      ""I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't
  think it's worth much more than where it is,"" said Joseph Doyle
  of Smith Barney.
      Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the ""burger
  wars"" between itself, McDonald's Corp &lt;MCD> and Pillsbury Co's
  &lt;PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food
  hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store
  sales last year, analysts said.
      Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced
  breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some
  analysts said the company should be bringing in new products,
  but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.
      There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be
  vulnerable to a takeover.
      James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth
  14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has
  improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high
  percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.
      ""They also have some attractive leaseholds on their
  restaurants,"" Murren said.
      Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,
  Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the
  fourth quarter. ""That was about the first time in seven
  quarters,"" he said.
      Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could
  be going on with Wendy's. ""My gut feeling is something's going
  to happen. I don't know what,"" she said.
      She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs
  per share.
      One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor
  because Wendy's decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead
  of Pepsi.
      Wendy's is currently embroiled in litigation brought by
  Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said.
  Pepsi's soda is still sold in the Wendy's restaurants.

"NEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC ON ROTTERDAM PORT ISSUES
  Employers and the port union, FNV, are
  to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the
  six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but
  neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told
  Reuters.
      Little progress was made in last night's three hours of
  talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.
      ""There is still a very large gap between the employers and
  the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement.
  But at least we are still talking,"" a union spokesman said.
      Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused
  the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all
  over the past two months.
      ""The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am
  really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at
  all.""
      ""If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to
  accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector,
  then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin
  later this month,"" Schoufour said.
      The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them
  more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the
  past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800
  redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with
  350 this year.
      Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said
  unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw
  the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy.
      Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out
  their cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from
  him before Wednesday at the earliest.

      Cyclops cited its agreement to be acquired by Britain's
  Dixons Group PLC for 90.25 dlrs a share under a tender offer
  that expires midnight March 17.
      Cyacq, comprising Audio/Video Affiliates Inc, Citicorp

  would increase its tender offer for Cyclops to 92.50 dlrs a
  share from 80 dlrs, subject to certain conditions.
      The conditions were that Cyclops provide Cyacq with

  with financial projections made by Dixons in its offer.
      Cyclops also said its board determined that Cyacq's
  announcement was not an offer. ""Cyacq's press release does not
  amend Cyacq's outstanding tender offer which remains at 80 dlrs
  per share and it does not state that Cyacq has financing
  commitments necessary to carry out its original offer or any

      Its agreements with Dixons are binding and Dixons indicated

  Money market rates rates showed a harder

      Dealers said the market was surprised by the Chancellor's

"DLR BELOW 150 YEN COUNTER TO PARIS PACT - MIYAZAWA
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said he
  regards a U.S. Dollar below 150 yen as counter to the agreement
  struck by major nations in Paris last month.
      He told the Upper House Budget Committee in Parliament that
  Japan intervened in the market when the dollar went below 150
  yen, as it considered the dollar's fall below that level
  counter to the spirit of the Paris accord.
      Commenting on current foreign exchange movements, Miyazawa
  said Japan would watch developments for another couple of days.
      Institutional investors appeared to have sold dollars to
  hedge currency risks ahead of the end of the financial year
  today, Miyazawa said.
      Behind the recent dollar fall lies the market perception
  that major nations were not doing enough to implement their
  policies under the Paris pact, he said, noting that passage of
  Japan's 1987/88 budget has been delayed.
      He said that now was the time for major nations to act
  under the Paris accord. The U.S., West Germany, France,
  Switzerland and Britain have intervened on their own account to
  prop up the dollar, he said. This was a concerted action.

"INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW
  Indonesia""s agriculture sector will grow
  by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct
  in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or
  declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.
      Production of Indonesia""s staple food, rice, is forecast to
  fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of
  26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on
  Indonesia""s agricultural performance.
      The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at
  26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in
  1987.
      The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln
  tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of
  a drawdown on stocks.
      ""Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look
  promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the
  production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no
  gain,"" the report says.
      ""The modest overall increase which is expected will be due
  to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil
  and palm kernels.""
      Constraints to significant overall increases in
  agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant
  seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by
  farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the
  report underlines.
      The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of
  pests known as ""wereng"" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which
  largely offset gains in yields.
      The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57
  insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now
  resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more
  resistant rice types.
      The government is depending on increased production of
  export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and
  palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude
  oil prices.
      Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct
  in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising
  to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the
  report says.
      But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will
  rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will
  also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.
      The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean
  meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last
  September""s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise
  in domestic demand.
      The report said that Indonesia""s overall economic
  performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight
  negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the
  mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct
  in 1984.
      The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible
  for the slump.
  

"
"U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA
  The U.S. Agriculture Department 
  formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to
  drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers
  for the cut with targeted income payments.
      In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying
  the ""Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987"", Peter Myers,
  Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration
  wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning
  with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.
      Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the
  government for the price support cut with targeted income
  payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would
  cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.
      The administration sugar proposal is expected to be
  introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.
  John Porter, R-Ill.
      Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it
  is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because
  politically-influential sugar and corn growers
  and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.
      The direct payment plan outlined by the administration 
  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually
  lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment
  any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.
      For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower
  would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3
  cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.
      The income payments would be based on the amount of
  commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985
  or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.
      Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes
  in the sugar program because the current high price support is
  causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.
      He said the current program has artificially stimulated
  domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed
  corn sweeteners to make market inroads.
      U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a
  ""progressive contraction"" of the sugar import quota to only one
  mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar
  refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.
      Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives
  overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a
  competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of
  sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing
  facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.
      USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on
  U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said
  consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than
  necessary for sugar.
      ""Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between
  sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse
  impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently
  facing,"" Myers said.
      The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per
  lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons
  recoverable raw sugar, under the administration's proposal to
  compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

"INDIAN RATE CUTS TO SPARK INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE
  The Indian Finance Ministry's
  announcement in Parliament yesterday, changing the nation's
  interest rate structure, will benefit industry and agriculture
  by providing loans at lower interest, bankers and brokers said.
      The changes, effective today, included reducing commercial
  bank lending rates that have ranged between 15 pct and 17.5 pct
  by one percentage point.
      New rates, which affect both Indian and foreign banks, also
  include a one percentage point gain, to an annual 10 pct, on
  deposits of two years or more but less than five.
      Bank deposits of five years or more carrying 11 pct
  interest have been abolished.
      Bankers said the interest rate modifications reflect the
  government's concern to reduce the costs of borrowing and help
  improve world competitiveness of Indian goods.
      There is likely to be a shift to short-term bank deposits
  by long-term depositors, bankers predicted. This will create
  the flexibility to draw and re-invest funds in either equity
  shares or short-term bank deposits, they said.
      A merchant banker also said reduced manufacturing costs due
  to lower lending rates are likely to boost the share market.
      Tata Steel, a trend setter on the Bombay Stock Exchange,
  opened today higher at 1,040 rupees against yesterday's closing
  of 1,012.50 rupees.
      A stockbroker said investors may be less enthusiastic now
  to buy convertible and non-convertible debentures because the
  Finance Ministry has reduced the annual interest rate to 12.5
  pct and 14 pct respectively from 13.5 and 15 pct respectively.
      ""But overall debenture prospects remain bright because the
  rates of interest on them will still be higher than what banks

"EC LINKS AGRICULTURAL TRADE TALKS TO OTHER REFORM
  The European Community (EC) considers
  talks on agricultural trade reform to be inseperable from talks
  on other trade reform in the present GATT round, Willy de
  Clercq, external relations commissioner of the EC, said.
      He told reporters here the EC would not bow to pressure to
  reach an early, seperate agreement on agricultural trade.
      He said the EC wanted to stick to the four-year schedule
  agreed by members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
  (GATT) in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last year. That included
  agricultural trade liberalisation for the first time in the
  lengthy program to re-negotiate the GATT.
      Other trade issues being discussed in the current GATT
  round include reform of trade in merchandise and services.
      De Clercq is on his way to China after attending a two-day
  conference for 22 GATT trade ministers held in New Zealand.
      Several of those ministers criticised the EC for what they
  saw as restrictive agricultural trade practices and called for
  urgent reforms. U.S. Trade representative, Clayton Yeutter,
  also said it was important agreement on agricultural trade
  reform was reached as early as possible.
      But de Clercq said the GATT program had been reached after
  long and hard negotiations, and the EC did not want changes.
      ""We just want to stick to the agreement which was reached,
  and that was very clear -- that the new round would be one
  undertaking. It is a global negotiation with no two tracks, no
  fast track, no slow track. It has just one track, the track -
  and that's all,"" de Clercq said.
      ""If you start selecting priorities, your priority is not my
  priority. We say that agriculture is urgent, but it's not the
  only urgent thing,"" he said.
      He said the Punte del Este agreement had taken eight months

      Under terms of the letter of intent, Degussa would
  contribute substantially to a three year exploration budget of
  4.5 mln dlrs in return for a 50 pct interest in the venture.
      Degussa's contribution to the exploration budget will be
  based on it matching International Platinum's past exploration
  and acquisition costs, estimated at about two mln dlrs, and
  then contributing on a pro rata basis, International Platinum
  said.
      Degussa's contribution would provide a major portion of
  International Platinum's exploration budget, especially during

"SAUDI OIL RESERVES RISE DESPITE HIGHER OUTPUT
  Proven oil and gas deposits in Saudi
  Arabia increased in 1986 despite higher oil output, according
  to the kingdom's main producing company, Aramco.
      Recoverable oil reserves in Aramco fields rose to 167
  billion barrels by the end the year from 166.5 billion in 1985,
  while gas reserves jumped by 7.7 pct to 135.8 trillion cu ft
  from 126.1 trillion, the company's annual report said.
      Aramco, responsible for all Saudi production except about
  200,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the Neutral Zone between Saudi
  Arabia and Kuwait, increased production to 4.69 mln barrels per
  day in 1986 from 3.04 mln barrels a year earlier.
  
      Most of 1986 was a virtual free-for-all in production, as
  OPEC members abandoned restraint in an effort to recapture
  their share of the market. In the process, prices collapsed
  from about 28 dlrs a barrel to below nine dlrs, until the
  organisation decided to cut production again from last
  September onwards.
      Saudi output in 1985 had been the lowest since the 1960s.
      Production of natural gas liquids in 1986 declined slightly
  to 304,178 bpd from 316,310, said the report, carried on the
  official Saudi Press Agency.
      The increase in reserves came despite a sharp cut in the
  number of wells Aramco drilled to 33 in 1986 from 103 in 1985.
  
      Aramco's only refinery, at Ras Tannurah, processed 142.44
  mln barrels (390,246 bpd) of crude last year. The plant was
  upgraded to a capacity of 530,000 bpd during the year, enabling
  it to supply 50 pct of local demand for oil products, the
  report said.
      The country's other five, smaller refineries -- owned by
  another state-owned oil organisation, Petromin -- produced
  around 750,000 bpd last year.
  
      Sulphur production rose to 1.23 mln tonnes in 1986 from
  998,707 tonnes in 1985. During the year the company began
  operating a sulphur granule plant with capacity of 4,000 tonnes
  per day, the report said.
      Aramco said it awarded 1,303 contracts last year worth 1.4
  billion riyals -- about 370 mln dlrs.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY
  Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden
  economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices
  will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists
  say.
      Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold
  oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the
  northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.
      Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross
  domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year
  after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.
      This was after taking into account inflation in consumer
  prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.
      Factors depressing economic activity include the
  6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which
  threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the
  Gulf and has sapped business confidence.
      But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September
  when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis
  caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive
  new debt settlement program was introduced.
      The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward
  trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.
      The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer
  spending, thus generating an informal credit system.
      Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are
  still owed by individuals and companies.
      There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs)
  in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which
  one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as
  bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it
  will not allow any banks to go under.
      The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of
  problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether
  debtors have regular cash flows or not.
      Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights
  guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance
  in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector
  is the biggest after oil.
      Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride
  out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.
      Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd)
  compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last
  year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.
      But strategic diversification into downstream operations in
  Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at
  home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell
  over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.
      Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average
  2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed
  product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as
  crude.
      Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason
  for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic
  inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent
  years and signs government spending on productive sectors will
  remain steady.
      External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8
  billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below
  that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit
  Gulf.
      Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put
  officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income
  of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.
      But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these
  reserves may not be enough to prevent a ""real"" budget deficit for
  the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.
      In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary,
  revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct,
  doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.
      This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded
  in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at
  up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some
  shortfall.
      Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for
  economic growth this year or next.
      ""It depends on oil prices,"" one said. ""This summer is
  important.""
      Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday
  the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state
  spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the
  economy.
      He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be
  spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.

  Zambian copper production rose 3.2 pct to

  Cooper Development Co said it

  mln dlrs, or 2.33 dlrs per share, down from the
  previously-reported loss of 12.1 mln dlrs, or 46 cts per share.
      The restatement was made because of change in the method of
  accounting for a combination of several company-controlled
  concerns that resulted in a 53.5 mln dlr charge, Cooper
  Development said.
      Last August Cooper Development combined its Cooper
  Biomedical Inc unit and its Cooper Laboratories subsidiary with
  Technicon Instruments Corp, a company acquired from Revlon Inc
  &lt;REV>, a Cooper spokesman said.
      The spokesman said the transaction was accounted for as an
  acquisition, but the Securities and Exchange Commission took
  issue with the accounting method and said it should be
  accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common
  control.
      This treatment requires that the costs associated with the
  transaction be expanded rather than capitalized as an
  intangible asset, the company said.
      It also said that, since the charged required an expensing

"TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER &lt;PCC>
  Emery Air Freight Corp topped a
  leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40
  mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer
  may surface.
      Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over
  Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share
  or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc.
      Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for
  Purolator exceeded their expectations.
      Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover
  values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share
  range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be
  taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
      Analysts today would not venture to say whether another
  offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the
  belief that the bidding could go higher.
      ""They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.
  Emery has shown the courage to go forth,"" said one arbitrager,
  who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as
  bidders.
      ""It makes sense,"" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.
  But ""It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a
  100 pct of the synergies.""
      Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in
  the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies
  and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's
  profitability.
      Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival
  United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package
  delivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>, which has 47
  pct of the market.
      Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would
  have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery
  business.
      ""This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight
  (delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,""
  said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co.
      Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and
  its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call.
      E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,
  but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on
  its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST.
      One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely
  Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a
  company outside the package delivery industry would want to
  outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same 
  synergies as a courier company.
      Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some
  of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary,
  speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come.
      The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator
  board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he
  believed a better offer could be made by another entity.
      A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had
  no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined
  up for Purolator.
      Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question
  by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted
  to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.
  Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday.
      Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could
  be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to
  keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279
  mln dlr ""bridge"" loan that would later be replaced with other
  debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator.
      Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n
  its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its
  279 mln dlr loan.
      Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln
  dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in
  revenues.

"U.S. GOLD EAGLE SALES PROJECTED AT 3.1 MLN OUNCES
  American Eagle gold bullion coin
  sales are projected at 3.1 mln troy ounces in their first year
  on the market, well above the target of 2.2 mln, Donna Pope,
  director of the U.S. Mint, told journalists.
      World sales, which began on October 20, 1986, reached 2.193
  mln ounces in less than six months of sales. This made it world
  market leader with a share of 37 pct in 1986, Pope said.
      Pope said that in volume terms, nearly half of all gold
  Eagle sales were within North America, roughly 40 pct were in
  Europe and about eight pct in Asia.
      She said despite introduction of several new gold bullion
  coins on the market recently, the Mint is aiming to preserve
  the Eagle's strong market share with extensive publicity.
      The Mint uses mainly newly mined U.S. Gold for the coins,
  as long as this is available at market prices. The remaining
  gold is taken either from U.S. Treasury stocks, or from the
  open market, Pope said.
      Gold analysts said the Eagle is facing competition here
  from the Canadian Maple Leaf, and also to a lesser extent from
  the South African Krugerrand. Some estimated the Maple Leaf's
  West German market share at 60 pct.
      The figures may be distorted, as many German investors buy
  gold bullion in Switzerland or Luxembourg to escape the 14 pct
  value-added tax imposed here. Including the tax, the one-ounce
  coins traded today at 906 marks, they said.
      Competition may also come from new gold coins, including
  Belgium's ECU, which began sales today. Britain and Australia
  also have plans to mint gold bullion coins, the analysts said.

  to a seasonally adjusted provisional 224 mln stg in February
  from 527 mln in January, The Trade and Industry Department
  said.
      The current account balance of payments in February showed
  a seasonally adjusted provisional surplus of 376 mln stg
  compared with a surplus of 73 mln in January.
      Invisibles in February were put provisionally at a 600 mln
  surplus, the same as in January.
      Seasonally adjusted, imports rose in February to 7.16
  billion stg from 6.73 billion in January. Exports rose to a
  record 6.93 billion last month from 6.20 billion in January.
      Trade Department officials said the improvement in
  Britain's current account contrasted with most private
  forecasts and they attributed much of the strength to imports
  rising less quickly in February than might otherwise have been
  expected.
      The Department said exceptionally cold weather in January
  reduced exports that month and that there had been an element
  of catching up in the February figures.
      The seasonally adjusted volume index, base 1980, a guide to
  underlying non-oil trade, showed exports rising to 131.0 from
  114.6 in January and imports rising to 142.2 from 136.5.
      The value of British oil exports in February rose to 751
  mln stg from 723 mln in Jnauary while oil imports rose to 425
  mln from 352 mln.
      The Department said the upward trend in non-oil export
  volume continues and the underlying level of non-oil import
  volume seems to have stablised.
      The Departnment said exports to the U.S. May be benefiting
  from fluctuations in the mark and yen exchange rates.

"NIPPON STEEL TO REDUCE DIVIDEND
  Nippon Steel Corp &lt;NSTC.T> plans to
  reduce its dividend to three yen in the year ending March 31
  1987 from the five yen of 1985/86, a company spokesman said.
      The company estimated parent company current losses at 15
  billion yen in 1986/87, including a gain of 95 billion yen from
  the sale of securities. This compares with a 36.07 billion yen
  profit a year earlier.
      Sales in 1986/87 are seen at 2,150 billion yen, down from
  2,685 billion a year ago.
      Poor business prospects were attributed to the yen's rise
  and slow world steel demand. Nippon is expected to report
  parent company results in late May.
      Total 1986/87 crude steel production is estimated at 25.57
  mln tonnes, down from 27.98 mln a year earlier.
      Crude steel production is likely to be below 1986/87 output
  but forecasts for profits and sales in the year starting April
  1 are unavailable yet, he said.

"FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR MOSCOW STILL OPPOSED
  The Reagan administration wants to
  encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not
  believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment,
  Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.
      ""It seems to me that more trade between us is better than
  less trade,"" he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.
      To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign
  policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the
  Soviet Union to lapse, he said.
      Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining
  export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited
  items and speeding up the licensing process, he said.
      Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that
  comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.
      U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries
  that restrict emigration and other rights.
      ""What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet

"MARKET WELCOMES LOWER AUSTRALIAN PAYMENTS DEFICIT
  The Australian dollar rose more than 40
  points and money market interest rates retreated on the better
  than expected improvement in the February current account
  deficit, but economists and dealers were cautious about
  identifying it as the start of a downward trend.
      The current account deficit narrowed to 750 mln dlrs in
  February from 1.23 billion in January. It hit 13.82 billion
  dlrs in 1985/86 to end-June.
      The currency jumped to 0.6858/63 U.S. Dlrs and traded as
  high as 0.6875 before retreating to around 0.6864/69.
      ""It's got 69 cents written all over it,"" one dealer said.
      Foreign exchange dealers said some buyers had gone long on
  the dollar expecting a lower figure and sold it down about 30
  points to 0.6820 U.S. Dlrs before the release.
      The 750 mln dlr deficit was at the lower end of forecasts
  and analysts said the market would welcome any figure below one
  billion dlrs for March.
      Banque National de Paris &lt;BNPP.A> senior dealer Peter
  Nicolls cautioned that in the long term the currency and
  interest rates were too high for import substitution and export
  industries.
      Nicolls said he expected the dollar to go as high as 0.6875
  and perhaps to 69 cents tomorrow.
      &lt;Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd> chief economist Will Buttrose said
  the 42 mln dlr trade surplus was encouraging as were imports at
  2.77 billion dlrs, down from 2.99 billion in January.
      But he warned that the outlook for rural and iron and coal
  exports remained poor. ""We should remember we are paying
  something like seven to eight billion dollars simply to service
  our foreign debt and that is not going to go away in the near
  term,"" Buttrose said.
      Buttrose said he expected a March deficit of around 900 mln
  dlrs, and added ""Any figure under a billion dollars will be
  acceptable (to the markets).""
      ANZ Banking Group Ltd &lt;ANZA.S> senior economist Ian Little
  said the big question was whether the improvement in exports
  could be sustained. February FOB exports rose to 2.82 billion
  dlrs from a revised 2.74 billion in January.
      Interest rates responded quickly to the deficit news, with
  90-day bank bill yields falling to 16.42-16.45 pct from early
  highs of 16.50 and yields yesterday as high as 16.65.
      Longer term yields fell with 10-year bonds at 13.66/68 pct
  from 13.74 before the release and highs of 13.87 yesterday.
      The stock market was easier at midsession but brokers said
  the current account data had little impact on trading.

"CANADA TO MONITOR STEEL IMPORTS, EXPORTS
  Canada plans to monitor steel shipments

  the government is taking further action to ensure we have more
  accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not
  used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers,""
  Carney said.
      Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to

      The January level was the worst since the Goverment started

"CCC GUARANTEES TO IRAQ SWITCHED --USDA
  The Commodity Credit Corporation
  (CCC) has transferred 12.0 mln dlrs in credit guarantees
  previously earmarked for sales of U.S. hatching eggs and 7.0
  mln dlrs in guarantees for breeder livestock to increase
  coverage on sales of U.S. protein concentrates to Iraq, the
  U.S. Agriculture Department said.
      The action was taken at the request of Iraq's State Trade

"RESORTS INT'L &lt;RT.A> RECEIVES TAKEOVER OFFER
  Resorts International Inc
  said it received a proposal from &lt;KSZ Co Inc> under which
  holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share
  in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be
  formed through the takeover.
      Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares
  would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of
  common stock in the new company.
      Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of
  Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware
  corporation.
      Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would
  be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220
  mln dlrs of equity.
      It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of
  special preferred stock.
      The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a
  commitment from &lt;M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special
  preferred stock.
      Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.
  It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,
  to advise its board on the offer.
      Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and
  certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B
  shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs
  a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the
  752,297 class B shares outstanding.
      Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining
  class B shares outstanding.
      Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding
  class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting
  power of the class B shares.
      Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made
  by Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT>.
      Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing
  class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of
  the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire
  Resorts.
      Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the
  merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the
  special preferred stock would immediately be converted into
  exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.
      This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on
  the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island
  operations.
      A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a
  two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it
  because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has
  asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.
      The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but
  that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the
  Denver oilman.
      Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles
  public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was
  not immediately available for comment.
      Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment, as was a
  spokesman for the Crosby estate.

"SUMITA SAYS BANK WILL INTERVENE IF NECESSARY
  Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita
  said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign

      Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including
  market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22
  Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.
      Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany
  agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around
  current levels. Sumita's statement was issued after the dollar
  slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.
      ""It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the
  system of floating rates,"" Sumita said.
      The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean
  anything significant under the floating system, he said.
      The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing
  then were broadly consistent with underlying economic
  fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage

"EQUITICORP TASMAN TO BID FOR MONIER LTD
  &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL) said it will
  offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of
  Monier Ltd &lt;MNRA.S>, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a
  share bid by CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S>.
      Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents
  cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.
      As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for
  Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by
  Friday.
      It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign
  Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as
  foreign because of its New Zealand base.
      The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28
  mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.
      Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
  alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the
  value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
  diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.
      ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
  conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment
  and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.
      ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the
  shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.
      ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate have
  targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion
  and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.
      Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement
  that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend
  acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.
      He also said Monier will not now proceed with the
  one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
  March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.
      As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex
  put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,
  Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of
  accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to
  50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.
      CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland
  taking the second option, resulting in the two companies
  running Monier as a joint venture.
      CSR officials have also said they had no intention of
  raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention
  became public last week.

      ""In view of the increase in our share price today, I want to
  make clear that we have not received any bid approaches,"" Reed's
  chairman Leslie Carpenter said in a statement.
      Rumours that U.S. Publisher Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc
  &lt;HBJ> might bid for Reed, a paper and printing company, pushed
  Reed shares up 54p at 600p at one stage today before they eased
  back to 564p at the close against a background of a widespread
  decline in U.K. Equity prices.
      Share market analysts said speculators were buying the
  stock on belief that Harcourt would bid for Reed in an effort
  to escape the unwelcome two billion dlr bid from Robert
  Maxwell's British Printing and Communication Corp &lt;BPCL.L>.
      Such a move would have made Harcourt too big for BPCC to
  take it over, analysts added.
      They also said there was some speculation that if BPCC's
  bid for Harcourt was unsuccessful, it could turn its attention
  to Reed.

"SOUTH AFRICAN MAIZE ESTIMATE CALLED CONSERVATIVE
  The South African government's
  maize production estimate of 7.8 mln tonnes for the current
  year is ""rather too conservative,"" leading grain and produce
  merchants Kahn and Kahn Pty Ltd said.
      The company, in a detailed report, estimated the harvest as
  high as 8.3 mln tonnes and said if this forecast is met the
  ostensible surplus for export will be approximately 2.25 mln
  tonnes.
      ""This paradoxically is creating a problem for the Maize
  Board,"" Kahn and Kahn said.
      It said the maize export price currently is depressed and
  the board is ""probably confronted with the necessity to maintain
  or slightly increase the internal price of maize again...To
  offset the ostensible loss which must be faced"" on exporting
  surplus amounts.

"U.S. ENERGY INDUSTRY SAID IN BETTER HEALTH
  The U.S. oil and gas industry is in
  better health than it was a year ago, according to testimony
  given to the Texas Railroad Commission at its annual state of
  the industry hearing today.
       The Commission, which regulates the state's oil and gas
  industry, heard testimony from a number of high-level company
  executives reflecting a belief that the recent industry
  downturn had bottomed out.
       ""The attitude expressed here today so far is a great deal
  more optimistic (than last year),"" Commissioner James E. (Jim)
  Nugent told Reuters.
       ""It reflects their (the executives) belief that they are
  seeing the bottom of the economic cycle,"" he added, ""and with
  just a few reasonable breaks this industry can begin to move
  again.""
       The energy industry was hard hit by the sharp drop in oil
  prices, which fell from around 30 dlrs a barrel in late 1985 to
  as low as 10 dlrs in mid-1986. Prices have since steadied to
  around 18 dlrs a barrel.
       At the same time, a number of company executives testified
  that the nation's domestic exploration and production segment
  was still hurting and in need of government help.
       Production costs are considerably higher in the United
  States than in such areas as the Middle East and as prices fell
  many domestic producers were forced to shut down their
  operations. Currently, there are only about 760 oil rigs
  operating in the United States compared with an average of
  nearly 2,000 in 1985.
       Citing a study released yesterday by the Department of
  Energy, many said the falling production of domestic oil
  coupled with increasing U.S. demand, was leading to a growing
  dependency on imports, particularly from the politically
  volatile Middle East.
       ""In the U.S., 1986 petroleum production responded to lower
  prices, increasing about 2.5 pct, or 400,000 barrels per day
  (bpd),"" said J.S. Simon, General Manager of the Supply
  Department at Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, the nation's largest oil
  company.
       At the same time, Simon said ""U.S. oil production declined
  by 300,000 bpd, the first decline in several years,"" and ""net
  petroleum imports were up 25 pct to 5.3 mln bpd.""
       Noting that while oil prices were expected to remain
  between 13 and 20 dlrs a barrel, depending on OPEC's ability to
  control production, Simon said demand is expected to remain at
  1986 levels, leading to ""a significant amount of spare
  worldwide production capacity, in excess of 10 mln bpd.""
       He said the surplus capacity would lead to continued
  volatility and called for ""governmental and regulatory policies
  in support of the domestic petroleum industry.""
       Citing the costs recently imposed by the federal
  government through the 1986 tax code changes and ""Superfund""
  legislation, Simon called for the repeal of the windfall
  profits tax, total decontrol of natural gas and improved access
  to federal lands for oil and gas exploration.
       Simon did not mention an oil import fee, which many in the
  industry have called for as a way of building up the nation's
  domestic operations before imports reach such a level that
  national security might be compromised.
       In yesterday's report, the Energy Department said imports
  could make up 50 pct of U.S. demand by 1995, adding that
  Persian Gulf producers will provide as much as 65 pct of the
  free world's total oil consumption by that date.
       Arguing that ""oil is a political tool in every nation on
  earth,"" Frank Pitts, chairman of &lt;Pitts Oil Co>, today called
  for a variable oil import fee, among other measures, ""before
  the treacherous foothold of the Middle East is irreversible and
  our national security is compromised.""
       Royce Wisenbaker, Chairman of Wisenbaker Production Co,
  agreed, saying that like many federal government programs that
  were set up with good intentions, it would probably turn into a
  ""shambles.""
       Wisenbaker added that he was optimistic for the future.
  ""For those of us who have managed to hold on, the worst is
  over,"" he said.
       Roger Hemminghaus, President of Diamond Shamrock Refining
  and Marketing Co, said he was ""enthusiastic about the future,""
  adding that he expected ""an increase in profitability by
  midyear.""

"SARNEY TEMPORARILY LEGALISES DLR PARALLEL MARKET
  Brazilian President Jose Sarney
  announced a move which temporarily legalises the purchase of
  U.S. Dollar currency in the parallel market, aimed at promoting
  imports of foreign goods.
      In a speech, Sarney justified his measure as a need to face
  ""current well known difficulties to obtain foreign loans for the
  purchase of goods.""
      The parallel market, although tolerated, is technically
  illegal. For the past year, the dollar in the parallel market
  is being sold at 25 to 100 pct above the official rate.
      Sarney's decision means that Brazilian importers of
  machinery and industrial equipment can buy dollar currency in
  the parallel market without having to wait for the issuing of
  an official order from the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
  Department (Cacex).
      Sarney also announced measures to boost exports in an
  effort to strengthen the country's trade balance and alleviate
  the risk of a reduction of foreign loans for this sector of the
  economy.
      The president authorised the National Foreign Trade Council
  (CONEX) to resume operating as the ruling body of Brazil's
  trade policy, with participation of the private sector.
      The Council had been closed three years ago by the military
  government of former President Joao Figueiredo.
      Tomorrow, Brazil was due to fulfill payment of 15 billion
  dollars in short range credit lines, but its economic officials
  have suggested a 60-day extension in the deadline in order to
  seek a renegotiation with its creditors.
      Sarney told members of the Council that for Brazil it is a
  must to recover its annual trade balance surplus to the 12
  billion dollars average recorded in 1984 and 1985, and which
  dropped sharply last year to 8 billion dollars.
      He attributed the poor performance of Brazil's trade
  balance in 1986 to protectionist moves by industrialised
  countries, the fall in the prices of basic goods and the crisis
  faced by several of Brazil's Third World trade partners.

"NORDBANKEN TO AUCTION ITS FERMENTA SHARES
  Sweden's &lt;Nordbanken> banking group
  said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan
  collateral by Fermenta AB's &lt;FRMS.ST> founder and former chief
  executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.
      The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --
  was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.
      The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's
  unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.
  Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for
  the shares although it expected to buy them back itself.
      The statement said the sale did not represent any
  withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta
  group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main
  shareholders.
      Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans
  of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which
  last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve
  its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main
  shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln
  crowns until a new equity issue could be made.
      Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'
  meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.
      Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown
  loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.
      Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln
  crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra
  170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and
  shareholder &lt;Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner
  &lt;Industrivarden AB>.
      The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been
  doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this
  week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the
  company was in a much worse state than he thought.

"THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER
  Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5

      It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht
  from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this
  year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials
  and semi-finished products.
      The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the
  first quarter due to lower oil prices.
      The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6
  billion baht from 56.6 billion.
      Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower
  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose
  earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26
  pct and canned pineapples seven pct.
      Products registering high export growth were jewellery up

"NO CLEAR EVIDENCE TRADE GAP REVERSED - VOLCKER
  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
  Volcker said current data does not give a clear sign that the
  deterioration in the U.S. trade balance has yet been reversed.
      ""The data we have in hand do not provide clearcut evidence
  that the deterioration in the trade balance has yet been
  reversed,"" Volcker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a
  luncheon for community leaders here.
      However, Volcker said there are encouraging signs,
  particularly the rising volume of exports over the past year,
  achieved despite relatively slow growth abroad.
      Volcker warned it is not sustainable from an economic
  perspective to pile up foreign debt while failing to make the
  investment needed to generate growth and earn the money to
  service the debt.
      He said the process of restoring external balance to the
  U.S. economy requires dealing with the budget deficit. He said
  needed economic adjustment will require a relative shift of
  financial and real resources into internationally competitive

"AUSTRALIAN SUGAR AREAS SAID RECEIVING SOME RAIN
  Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane
  belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough
  rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers
  Association spokesman said.
      The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but
  rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are
  needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay
  regions, he said from Brisbane.
      Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state
  and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very
  good after heavy falls this month, he said.
      The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what
  effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which
  is harvested from around June to December.
      He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are
  short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need
  about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to
  restore normal moisture to the cane.
      But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial
  to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.
      ""It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it
  might be in a month without some good falls,"" he said.

"STRONG DEMAND FOR PERU BISMUTH IN JAN/MAY
  Very strong demand from all markets
  including, recently, Japan has resulted in Peru's bismuth
  exports showing an impressive increase in January/May 1987,
  Peru's state owned mining industry's marketing arm Minpeco S.A.
  Said.
      In a statement released by its London office, Minpeco said
  Peruvian customs figures for bismuth exports for the first five
  months were 574.8 tonnes compared with 160.7 tonnes in the same
  period of 1986 and 483.4 tonnes during the whole of 1986,
  Minpeco said.
      A breakdown of the figures showed Peru exported 296.4
  tonnes of bismuth to the U.S. During Jan/May 1987 compared with
  127.0 during the whole of 1986. Other recipients were Peoples

"NO FRENCH REFLATION, SOURCES CLOSE TO BALLADUR SAY
  There is no question of stimulating
  consumption or relying on a systematic budget deficit or other
  reflationary policies to boost the French economy, sources
  close to finance minister Edouard Balladur said.
      Their comments followed remarks by prime minister Jacques
  Chirac's spokesman Denis Baudouin, who said on Monday ministers
  were agreed on the desirability of ""relaunching"" the economy.
      This sparked speculation the government was preparing for a
  reflationary U-turn, but the finance ministry immediately ruled
  out any such move.
      The sources today said the government's policy remained one
  of ""recovery,"" or sound finances and greater efficiency.
      They said that while 8.6 billion of the 30 billion franc
  revenues expected for 1987 from a sweeping privatisation
  program will go to providing public companies with fresh
  capital, 21.4 billion francs, or two-thirds, will go toward
  paying off national debt.
      Any further privatisation revenue this year above the 30
  billion would be distributed between repayment of national
  internal debt and public companies in similar proportions, they
  added.
      The sources said it was absurd to talk of reflation when
  the country's internal debt, expected to grow by 10 pct this
  year from 1,300 billion francs in 1986 was growing twice as
  fast as gross domestic product.
      Nominal GDP is expected to grow by roughly five pct this
  year from 5,000 billion francs last year, broadly in line with
  earlier forecasts. Real GDP will grow by up to 2.5 pct.
      The sources said that with France's economic targets for
  1987 roughly in line with its main trading partners, the
  government had no intention of pushing the economy to grow at
  an artificial pace out of step with neighbouring economies.

"WILLIAMS HOLDINGS BIDS 542.2 MLN STG FOR NORCROS
  Industrial holding company Williams
  Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary
  shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.
      The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams
  shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share
      Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last
  night of 397p.
      A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits
  of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to
  propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash
  alternative.
      The offer will include a partial convertible alternative
  under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69
  mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their
  ordinary share allocations.
      The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one
  Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a
  value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.
      Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986
  rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.
      Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in
  the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it
  centred on &lt;Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then
  switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.
      Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with
  Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which
  replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also
  result from normal trading.
      In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise
  in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover
  that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln
      Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a
  market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of
  acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its
  capitalisation up to around 380 mln.
      The convertible offer would be on the basis of four
  Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a
  share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of
  400.2p a share.
      The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price
  down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.
      Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or
  0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.
      There was no immediate response from Norcros.

"CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK
  The Canadian government is expected
  to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn
  exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S.
  government and farm group representatives said.
      The deadline for a final determination is March 7.
      U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a
  similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case,
  Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the
  Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn
  exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.
      Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn
  imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last
  month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to 
  corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

"SNC GROUP EXPECTS HIGHER 1987 EARNINGS, SALES
  &lt;SNC Group Inc> expects 1987 earnings
  to rise to 1.20-1.40 dlrs a share from 91 cts a share last
  year, with revenues climbing to about 430 mln dlrs from last
  year's 350 mln dlrs, president Alex Taylor said before the
  annual meeting.
      SNC, Canada's second biggest engineering and construction
  group, became the country's largest ammunition manufacturer
  last year with its 90 mln dlr acquisition of Canadian Arsenals
  Ltd from the Canadian government.
      The impact of that and several smaller deals will be felt
  fully in 1987, Taylor said.
      Defense preoducts and other manufacturing operations will
  account for more than half SNC's total 1987 revenues, helping
  to counterbalance the more cyclical engineering and
  construction acivities, Taylor said.
      Last year, SNC earned 8.7 mln dlrs, including a small
  extraordinary gain.
      In 1987, a total manufacturing activities will generate
  about 235 mln dlrs in revenues, and engineering and
  construction about 200 mln dlrs, he said, adding that defense
  products operations should be a major contributor to earnings.

"ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY
  A study of salmonella poisoning has
  uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding
  antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that
  can infect humans and resist medicines.
      Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control
  tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is
  resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the
  resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote
  the growth of cattle.
      Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of
  antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have
  been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs
  is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.
      Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases
  that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect
  humans.
      But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England
  Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.
      The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number
  of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant
  infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to
  298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the
  victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized
  for their illness.
      They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always
  prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating
  raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, ""the
  majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating
  hamburger that was at least partially cooked.""
      The researchers said the results show that ""food animals are
  a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections
  in humans, and that these infections are associated with
  (antibiotic) use on farms.""

"INDEPENDENT CHAIRMAN FOR DUTCH CARGO DISPUTE
  The two sides in the Rotterdam port
  general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent
  chairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings,
  employers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.
      Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of
  Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an
  agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and
  unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.
      Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in
  protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the
  4,000-strong workforce this year.
      The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on
  March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction
  against the redundancies on procedural grounds.
      The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but
  Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the
  employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the
  complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.
      Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement
  in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance
  workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a
  spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the
  sector, said.
      The employers have written to the union asking it to
  reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been
  called for tomorrow.

"EC WATCHING GULF WAR DEVELOPMENTS
  The European Community (EC) should
  watch very carefully for any developments in the Gulf War and
  their consequences on the oil market, EC Energy Commissioner
  Nicolas Mosar said today.
      Speaking two weeks after a U.S. warship was attacked in the
  Gulf, Mosar warned, ""An escalation in the Gulf would increase
  tensions in the oil market.""
      ""But I do not want to be alarmist,"" he told a news conference
  after an EC energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg.
      He said the volume of EC oil imports from the Gulf had
  declined to around 31 pct of total oil imports in the first
  three months of 1987 against 35 pct in the same period last
  year. ""There are also other potential sources of supplies in the
  world,"" he added.
      The issue of Gulf oil imports was not discussed at the
  ministers' meeting, he added.
      A EC committee of national experts in the so-called oil
  supply group would discuss Gulf oil supplies at their bi-annual
  meeting on June 19, he said.
      But any major decisions would have to be reserved for EC
  foreign ministers, diplomats said.
      West European nations have so far shown little enthusiasm
  for backing a U.S. plan to give military protection to merchant
  ships in the Gulf which could help insure the safety of oil
  supplies.

"HUNGARY RAISES PRICES IN EFFORT TO CURB DEFICIT
  Hungary has announced sharp price
  increases for a range of food and consumer products as part of
  its efforts to curb a soaring budget deficit.
      The official MTI news agency said the government decided
  consumer price subsidies had to be cut to reduce state
  spending. From today the price of meat will rise by an average
  18 pct and that of beer and spirits by 10 pct, MTI said.
      MTI said consumer goods will also become more expensive,
  with the price of refrigerators rising some five pct. It also
  announced a number of measures to ease hardship, including
  higher pensions and family allowances.
      Statistics indicate the budget deficit tripled in 1986 to
  47 billion forints. Central banker Janos Fekete has said the
  Finance Ministry is trying to cut the 1987 shortfall to between
  30 and 35 billion from a planned 43.8 billion.
      A major tax reform, including the introduction of a
  Western-style valued added tax, is planned for January 1988 in
  an effort to cure problems in state spending.
      But diplomats said the latest announcement shows the
  authorities were forced to act quickly to keep this year's
  deficit under control.
      The measures are also aimed at cooling an overheated
  economy, and could help dampen Hungarians' appetite for
  imported Western goods which consume increasingly expensive
  hard currency, the diplomats said.
      The diplomats also said, however, that they did not expect
  the kind of social unrest that followed sharp price rises in
  other East Bloc states, notably Poland.

      Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that
  he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the
  sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.
      He also declined to specify at what price the company would
  consider selling it shares.
      ""Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of
  Dome Mines stock) are very attractive,"" Annesley commented.
      ""We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time
  when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs,"" he added. A
  price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered ""fairly
  attractive,"" Annesley said.
      Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome
  Mines' shares at a premium to market prices. ""There might be an
  opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be
  virtually a control block in Dome Mines,"" he said.
      Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on

"KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS
  The Kenyan economy is heading for
  difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must
  tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging
  too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.
      In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said
  high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth
  of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.
      The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of
  payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in
  1985, he added.
      ""But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a
  result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange
  reserves during the year,"" he said.
      The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign
  exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a
  peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.
      Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a
  barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.
      Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline
  in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more
  difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.
      Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on
  servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of
  capital for the first time in its history, he added.
      ""This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult
  phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that
  we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign
  sources to finance our development,"" he said.
      ""It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on
  expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the
  lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more
  frugal in satisfying immediate needs,"" the president added.

"AMOCO &lt;AN> OIL RESERVES DOWN, GAS UP IN 1986
  Amoco Corp's petroleum liquids reserves
  total 2.42 billion barrels at the end of 1986, down from 2.77
  billion a year earlier, but its natural gas reserves increased
  to 15.37 trillion cubic feet from 15.14 trillion, the company's
  annual report said.
      It said the drop in crude oil and natural gas liquid
  reserves reflected downward revisions of previous estimates
  caused by the sharp drop in oil prices last year. This
  accounted for 178 mln barrels of a worldwide downward revision
  of 188 mln barrels, with 158 mln barrels of the total revision
  occurring in the United States, the report said.
      Amoco said there were upward revisions in the size of its
  worldwide gas reserves totalling 404 billion cubic feet last
  year, while it discovered 568 billion cubic feet and purchased
  298 billion cubic feet of reserves.
      Production of one trillion cubic feet offset much of these
  gains, the report said.
      All of the gas reserve purchases, as well as all of the 14
  mln barrels of oil reserves bought in 1986, were in the United
  States, Amoco said, noting it has spent 1.1 billion dlrs to
  acquire U.S. producing properties over the past three years.
      Commenting on 1987, Amoco said acquisitions ""will be an
  integral part of our strategy, should reserves become available
  at attractive prices.""
      The company said it expects ""the marketing climate for
  natural gas to improve in 1987, which should provide the
  opportunity for Amoco to expand sales. As prices and demand
  improve, we are poised to accelerate capital spending on our
  inventory of attractive opportunities.""
      Amoco previously announced a 1987 capital spending budget
  of 3.2 billion dlrs. Such spending totaled 3.18 billion dlrs
  last year, down from 5.31 billion in 1985.

"SOUTH KOREA TO KEEP TRADE SURPLUS 3-5 YEARS
  South Korean Trade Minister Rha
  Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for
  three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt.
      He said in an interview with Reuter that after a few years
  it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods
  and move toward a more balanced trade position.
      He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation
  was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.
      Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a
  trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of 
  900 mln dlrs.
      Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission
  here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products
  valued at 1.8 billion dlrs.
      About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases here were in goods of
  the type South Korea normally bought from Japan.
      Rha leaves today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian
  officials and businessmen.
      Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if
  Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said ""at this

"MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES
  Middle East currency dealers meet in
  Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their
  business, which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from
  the Arab world to London.
      The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association
  also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf
  currency system is more real that at any time this decade.
      Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these
  issues, and the slide of the Lebanese pound, can be expected to
  be major talking points.
      About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks --
  including some in London and other major non-Arab financial
  centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins
  on on Saturday.
      Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a
  growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market,
  by far the largest in the region, is being carried out in
  London.
      The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabia's 11 banks,
  foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in
  Bahrain. But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based
  banks are boosting their treasury operations in London.
      As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade
  finance in the region declined, many offshore banks in Bahrain
  ran down their currency operations. None of the four major U.K.
  Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island.
      The two major Bahrain-based international banks, &lt;Arab
  Banking Corp> and &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> have increased
  their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading
  representative offices to branch status to allow dealing.
      One economist said: ""It is cheaper to run a riyal book in
  London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain...
  There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London.""
      Jeddah-based &lt;Riyad Bank> set up as a licensed deposit
  taker in London in 1984, while its main rival in Saudi Arabia,
  &lt;National Commercial Bank> (NCB) won a licence in November
  1986.
      The major market maker has traditionally been London-based
  consortium bank &lt;Saudi International Bank> but the kingdom
  joint-venture &lt;Saudi American Bank> (SAMBA) also upgraded its
  London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February.
      One senior currency trader in Riyadh said: ""Inevitably the
  volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new
  licences for NCB and SAMBA, but there is no question that most
  of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia.""
      Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi
  riyal market is difficult to quantify.
      Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency
  deposits held by offshore banks, most in Saudi riyals, dropped
  to the equivalent of 12.2 billion dlrs at end-September 1986
  from 13.4 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 15.0 billion.
      The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits. Riyal
  trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very
  quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now
  staff offices on Friday, the Gulf weekend. Traders also expect
  &lt;Arab National Bank> to step up London operations.
      Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market
  moving completely out of the region, partly because of local
  demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian
  Monetary Agency's (SAMA) desire to moderate
  internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue
  speculation.
      There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market
  shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain
  and London is still limited.
      But for the first time since the formation of the six
  nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) in 1981 there are signs
  that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon.
      Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final
  currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia,
  Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.
      But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary
  System style with a common peg have been discussed at high
  level and could be a topic on the GCC's annual summit expected
  to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year.
      One dealer said: ""A lot of exposure is being given to
  discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced. But in the
  end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead.""
      One open question is that of a common peg for currencies.
      The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated
  since the start of the GCC. The Kuwaiti dinar is currently
  linked to a basket of currencies while the other five
  currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the
  U.S. Dollar.
      Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation
  against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies,
  but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of
  7-1/4 pct, large enough to avoid sudden strains.
      Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued
  slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the
  undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks.

      Based on the previous January figures issued on February 9,

"U.S. TO END NETHERLANDS ANTILLES TAX TREATY
  The Treasury Department said it
  notified the Netherlands that it was terminating the 1948
  income tax treaty as it applies to the Netherlands Antilles and
  Aruba.
      The termination is effective January 1, 1988, the Treasury
  said in a two-sentence announcement.
      The Treasury decided to end the treaty after negotiations
  between the United States and the Netherlands over the past
  eight years had failed to reach an accord, a Treasury spokesman
  said.
      The decision means the sale by U.S. parent companies of
  Eurobonds through Netherlands Antilles subsidiaries will no
  longer be free of the 30 pct U.S. withholding tax, the
  spokesman said.
      Terminating the tax treaty with the Netherlands Antilles 
  may cause bond issuers to call in the bonds early. Most have
  maturities of 10 years or less and were issued before 1984, the
  spokesman said.
      He said the Treasury did not expect the action to have an
  adverse effect on U.S. issuers of the bonds because the general
  decline in interest rates means they will be able to refinance
  at lower interest rates.
      However, the holders of the bonds presumably will be faced
  with lower yields.

  Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegian

  just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers
  said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.
      Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told
  Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries
  operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for
  investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic
  slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.
      Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in
  Norway since 1985.
      Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's
  second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved
  later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would
  make profit this year.
      Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but
  Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned
  liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a
  steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.

"FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS
  French industry is failing to produce the
  goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left
  the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the
  economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and
  Development said.
      With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct
  this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb
  to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9
  pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.
      The report said the French economy was ""increasingly
  ill-adapted to demand"" selling goods at ""uncompetitive relative
  prices on both domestic and export markets.""
      ""France's poor export performance reflects a geographical
  bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average...
  And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18
  months,"" it said.
      Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit
  to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986,
  it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the
  franc could lead to ""a (renewed) loss of competitiveness
  relative not only to the United States but also to the newly
  industrialised countries.""
      This could result in further major losses of market share,
  particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a
  quarter of French exports, it said.
      Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the
  authorities would have ""little scope for macroeconomic
  manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to
  encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow
  more briskly,"" it added.
      But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage
  demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a
  two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.
      Written mainly in December last year, the report took no
  account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct
  surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the
  government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.
      ""We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke
  runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has
  been lost,"" one OECD official commented.
      OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil
  prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the
  report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast
  to around 2.5 or three pct.
      The government last week revised its forecast up to between
  2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.
      But the OECD backed the government's view that the
  underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year,
  with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's
  fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of
  disinflation.
      With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in
  the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and
  its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one
  pct this year, it said.
      On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for
  industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply
  as companies built up their profits.
      ""For the disinflationary process to continue , and price
  competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange
  rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue,""
  it said.

"USDA COMMENTS ON EXPORT SALES REPORT 
  U.S. corn sales of just over 1.0 mln
  tonnes in the week ended April 2 were eight pct above the prior
  week, but 25 pct below the four-week average, the U.S.
  Agriculture Department said.
      In comments on its latest Export Sales Report, the
  department said Iraq, Japan and the USSR were the largest
  buyers.
      Sales for the next marketing year, which begins September
  1, totaled 503,200 tonnes and were mainly to Iraq and Taiwan.
      Wheat sales of 119,300 tonnes for the current season and
  net reductions of 13,700 tonnes for the 1987/88 season were
  four-fifths below the combined total for the prior week and the
  four-week average, it said.
      Sri Lanka was the most active wheat destination with
  purchases of 52,500 tonnes for the current year, it said.
      Other significant purchasers for the current year were
  Mexico and Honduras, it said.
      Soybean sales of 240,500 tonnes were one-fifth below the
  prior week and nearly one-third below the four-week average.
      Japan, Mexico, South Korea, Italy and Israel were the major
  purchasers, the department said.
      Net sales of 117,700 tonnes of soybean cake and meal fell
  31 pct from the previous week and 38 pct below the four-week
  average. Major increases for West Germany, Venezuela, the
  Netherlands and Saudi Arabia were partially offset by
  reductions for unknown destinations, USDA said.
      Activity in soybean oil resulted in decreases of 2,400
  tonnes, with sales to unknown destinations down by 2,700
  tonnes, while sales to Canada increased 200 tonnes, the
  Department said.
      Combined sales of 71,300 running bales of cotton -- 60,200
  bales for the current season and 11,100 bales for 1987/88
  season -- were four-fifths higher than the prior week's level
  but nine pct below the four-week average.
      Mexico was the dominant buyer for the current year followed
  by Zaire, Italy, and Spain, the department said.
  The primary buyers for the 1987/88 season were South Korea,
  Spain, Japan and Taiwan, the department said.
      Sorghum sales of 143,300 tonnes were 25 pct less than the
  prior week, with Japan and Venezuela the main buyers.

"U.S. IMMIGRATION RULES SPARK CONGRESS OBJECTIONS
  New immigration rules relating to
  alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S.
  Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress,
  sources on Capitol Hill said.
      USDA is drafting regulations, required by a 1986 law, that
  would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the
  cultivation of fruits, vegetables and other perishable
  commodities.
      The department is considering including in its definition
  of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco, hops,
  Spanish reeds and Christmas trees, while excluding sugar cane,
  the New York Times reported yesterday.
      Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., would like to see the
  definition extended to include sugar cane, cultivation of which
  is ""a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation,""
  Gene Smith, a spokesman for Berman, said.
      Livestock, dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying
  USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty
  provision, farm industry sources said.
      Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said
  livestock producers were ""desperate"" because they fear they will
  be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined
  that industry.
      A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986
  immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress
  did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers
  who helped cultivate tobacco, and that inclusion of hops and
  Spanish reeds was ""marginal.""
      In addition, lawmakers made it clear during consideration
  of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the
  the amnesty provisions, making the inclusion of Christmas trees
  ""a tough call,"" this source said.
      USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation
  except to say it was subject to change before it will be
  released, probably some time later this month.
      While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under
  consideration relating to perishable commodities, Congress is
  not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration
  question, congressional sources said.
      The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers
  was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill.
      Congressional staff members estimate the special farm
  worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to
  350,000 aliens. The law would allow eligible farm workers who
  worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1, 1986, to apply
  for temporary, then permanent, resident status.

"ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER
  Argentine grain producers again
  reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87
  soybean crop, which will begin to be harvested in mid-April,
  trade sources said.
      They said growers now forecast soybean production this
  season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes, down from last week's
  estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln
  tonnes forecast in mid-February.
      The new forecast is still higher than last season's record
  total production.
      Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to
  7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast
  for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1
  mln tonnes, 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season's new estimates.
      Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods
  in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe
  provinces and northern Buenos Aires.
      The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures
  and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty
  pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.
      The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to
  3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86
  record of 3.34 mln hectares.
      The state of the crop continued to be good in general until
  last week but intense, heavy rains since could have caused
  damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.
      Where the rains were less heavy they were considered
  beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.
      The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in
  southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to
  influence production forecasts.
      In other areas, especially western Buenos Aires, where
  rainfall was more than 200 mm, parts of the sunflower, maize
  and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.
      The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by
  rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba, La
  Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.
      The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and
  3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln
  hectares in 1985/86.
      The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at
  between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.
      This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to
  12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production
  and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.
      The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the
  area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires
  although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.
      A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is
  impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of
  sunshine dries the fields.
      The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares, down
  29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year's record 3.14 mln hectares.
      Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3
  to 2.6 mln tonnes, 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of
  4.1 mln tonnes.
      The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the
  rains, advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting
  in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.
      The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2
  pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.
      Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, 16.7 to
  22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.

"DOLLAR SEEN FALLING UNLESS JAPAN SPURS ECONOMY
  Underlying dollar sentiment is bearish,
  and operators may push the currency to a new low unless Japan
  takes steps to stimulate its economy as pledged in the Paris
  accord, foreign exchange analysts polled by Reuters said here.
      ""The dollar is expected to try its psychological barrier of
  150.00 yen and to fall even below that level,"" a senior dealer
  at one leading bank said.
      The dollar has eased this week, but remains stable at
  around 151.50 yen. Six major industrial countries agreed at a
  meeting in Paris in February to foster currency stability.
      Some dealers said the dollar may decline in the long term,
  but a drastic fall is unlikely because of U.S. Fears of renewed
  inflation and fears of reduced Japanese purchases of U.S.
  Treasury securities, needed to finance the U.S. Deficit.
      Dealers generally doubted whether any economic package
  Japan could adopt soon would be effective enough to reduce its
  trade surplus significantly, and said such measures would
  probably invite further U.S. Steps to weaken the dollar.
      Under the Paris accord, Tokyo promised a package of
  measures after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed to boost
  domestic demand, increase imports and cut its trade surplus.
      But debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition
  boycott of Parliamentary business over the proposed imposition
  of a five pct sales tax, and the government has only a slim
  chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near
  future, the dealers said.
      If no such steps are taken, protectionist sentiment in the
  U.S. Congress will grow, putting greater downward pressure on
  the dollar, they said.
      The factors affecting the U.S. Currency have not changed
  since before the Paris accord, they added.
      ""Underlying sentiment for the dollar remains bearish due to
  a still-sluggish U.S. Economic outlook, the international debt
  crisis triggered by Brazil's unilateral suspension of interest
  payments on its foreign debts and the reduced clout of the
  Reagan administration as a result of the Iran/Contra arms
  scandal,"" said a senior dealer at a leading trust bank.
      ""There is a possibility that the dollar may decline to
  around 140.00 yen by the end of this year,"" said Chemical Bank
  Tokyo branch vice president Yukuo Takahashi.
      But operators find it hard to push the dollar either way
  for fear of possible concerted central bank intervention.
      Dealers said there were widespread rumours that the U.S.
  Federal Reserve telephoned some banks in New York to ask for
  quotes last Wednesday, and even intervened to sell the dollar
  when it rose to 1.87 marks.
      The Bank of England also apparently sold sterling in London
  when it neared 1.60 dlrs on Wednesday, they said.
      But other dealers said they doubted the efficacy of central
  bank intervention, saying it may stimulate the dollar's decline
  because many dealers are likely to await such dollar buying
  intervention as a chance to sell dollars.
      However, First National Bank of Chicago Tokyo Branch
  assistant manager Hiroshi Mochizuki said ""The dollar will not
  show drastic movement at least to the end of March.""
      Other dealers said the U.S. Seems unwilling to see any
  strong dollar swing until Japanese companies close their books
  for the fiscal year ending on March 31, because a weak dollar
  would give Japanese institutional investors paper losses on
  their foreign holdings, which could make them lose interest in
  purchases of U.S. Treasury securities.
      U.S. Monetary officials may refrain from making any
  comments this month to avoid influencing rates, they said.

"ATTACKS AFFECT COLOMBIA'S OIL OUTLOOK-ECOPETROL
  Continuous rebel raids against oil

  present oil bonanza, Franciso Chona, manager of the state-run
  oil company Ecopetrol said.
      ""It seems the subversion wants to end with our oil bonanza,""
  he told reporters.
      He was speaking after a meeting with Defense Minister
  Rafael Samudio, military chiefs and Mines and Energy Minister
  Guillermo Perry to review the security situation in the light
  of a recent upsurge of leftist guerrilla attacks in the
  oil-rich Arauca region, bordering Venezuela.
      Ecopetrol chief of security, Retired General Carlos
  Narvaez, said security measures would be stricter and that the
  armed forces were closely collaborating but gave no details.
      Samudio said new plans had been designed and hoped they
  would be effective. Samudio stressed that, despite the most
  recent attacks, which cost more than four mln dlrs in damage,
  the overall situation had improved compared with last December
  when initial measures were taken to combat a wave of attacks.
      Repeated bombings of a vital pipeline from the Cano Limon
  oilfield to the Caribbean then led to a loss of 51,000 barrels
  of crude.

      The units have been operating under protection of Chapter
  11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since last November.
      McLean said U.S. Lines has a letter of intent with CSX
  Corp's &lt;CSX> Sea-Land Corp subsidiary to transfer assets of its
  Transpacific/Hawaii/Guam Service to Sea-Land.
      McLean said Sea-Land has tentatively agreed to pay 125 mln
  dlrs for six vessels, certain port facilities, and various
  other equipment used in U.S. Lines' Transpacific service and
  theree Lancer class vessels and subsidy rights owned by the two
  McLean subsidiaries.
      As previously announced, U.S. Lines (S.A.) will transfer
  its South American Service to &lt;Crowley Maritime Corp>'s
  American Transport Lines Inc subsidiary in return for a fixed
  lease payment for the four Lancer class vessels and a
  participation based on American Transport's South American
  revenues.
      McLean said the agreement also calls for Crowley to release
  U.S. Lines (S.A.) for any damages and unpaid charter hire for
  three vessels leased to U.S. Lines (S.A.) by Crowley which have
  been returned to Crowley.
      McLean said the minimum lease payments will be seven mln
  dlrs and estimated revenue participation during the first four
  years at about 16 mln dlrs. In addition, U.S. Lines (S.A.)
  subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina will be sold to American
  Transport.
      The company said both agreements in principle have been
  approved by directors of the companies involved, but still need
  court, regulatory and lender approval.
      McLean said it is requesting the bankruptcy court to
  schedule a hearing on its motion to approve the agreements,
  adding that the court has granted the company's request to
  extend for 90 days the period for the shipping companies to
  file a proposed plan of reorganization.
      It said the planned transactions will leave McLean with no

"H.K. DEALERS SAY NAKASONE G-6 COMMENT TOO LATE
  Remarks by Japan's Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone that last month's G-6 meeting agreed to
  stabilize the dollar above 150 yen have come too late to
  influence currency trading, dealers said.
      After Nakasone's statement the dollar rose to 146.40/50 yen
  from an initial low of 144.20/40 and New York's Friday finish
  of 147.15/25. But the rebound was largely on short-covering,
  they said.
      ""I think (Nakasone's) desperate,"" said a U.S. Bank foreign
  exchange manager.
      Nakasone told a Lower House Budget Committee in Parliament
  that Japan and other industrialized nations committed
  themselves in Paris last month to stabilize the dollar above
  150 yen.
      Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told the same committee
  that the six - Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And
  West Germany - had intervened aggressively since the dollar
  fell below 150 yen.
      ""His (Nakasone) remarks should have been made and should
  have had a bigger influence when the dollar was still above 150
  yen,"" said P.S. Tam of Morgan Guaranty Trust.
      Tam said the dollar has hit short-term chart targets  and
  is likely to rebound. But he warned of another dip to below 145
  yen.
      Dealers said the worsening trade relations between the U.S.
  And Japan will continue to depress the dollar.
      The trade issue has now become a political issue since the

"CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS
  ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
  higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
  Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
      Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
  over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
  mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
      ""This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
  maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
  bidder,"" an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
  announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
      ""This is totally by surprise,"" said Debra Strohmaier, a
  ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
  scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
  announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
  certain when it would be ready. 
      She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
  between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
      ""I think they will resist it,"" said Elliott Schlang,
  analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. ""Any company that
  doesn't like a surprise attack would.""
      Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
  offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
  could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
  acquired by Waste Management.
      Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
  ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
  examples of companies that could be interested.
      ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
  company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
  herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
  wastes.
      Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
  another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
  residential and commercial distribution system.
      Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
  catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
  the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
      Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
  fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
  the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
      Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
  individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

  mexico's proven reserves of liquid
  hydrocarbons at end-1986 were 70 billion barrels, slightly down
  from 70.9 billion a year ago and 71.75 billion in 1984, the
  state oil company petroleos mexicanos (pemex) announced.
      Reserves were just 5.77 billion barrels in 1974, rose
  sharply to 40.19 billion in 1978 and flattened out at 72
  billion in both 1981 and 1982.
      In its annual report, pemex said average crude output in
  1986 was 2.43 mln barrels per day, 202,000 bpd down on 1985.
  Average exports were 1.29 mln bpd, down from 1.44 mln bpd.

"USX &lt;X> SAYS TALKS ENDED WITH BRITISH PETROLEUM
  USX Corp chairman David Roderick said
  the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>
  about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has
  no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses.
      ""We have terminated our discussions,"" Roderick told Reuters
  after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association
  here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other
  possible buyer of its energy assets.
      Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per
  share for the Standard Oil Co's &lt;SRD> publicly held stock.
      USX said in December the company had held formal
  discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its
  overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of
  interest from a half dozen other oil companies.
      Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no
  immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas
  Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of
  its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas.
      ""We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field
  during these difficult times,"" Roderick added.
      In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not
  know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was
  accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested
  Holmes a Court was buying additional shares.
      Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion
  dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold
  a sizable interest in the company. ""Mr. Ichan still apparently
  has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,""
  Roderick said. ""He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I
  talk with him monthly.""
      In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of
  the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade
  deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.
      ""I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net
  trade surplus,"" Roderick said. ""I think the worst is over and
  we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead.""
      However, the USX chairman warned that European trading
  partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. ""Some
  economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States
  to our friends, trading partners and allies.""

"IRVING BANK &lt;V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL
  Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop
  in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the
  result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in
  Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
      Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
  from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share
  dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.
      Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of
  Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net
  income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.
      Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
  dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
  these loans during the remainder of 1987.
      Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
  trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
  although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
  profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
  gains, the bank said.
      The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from
  185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was
  21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.

"VENEZUELA GETS 300 MLN DLRS CREDIT FOR ALUMINUM
  Venezuela has obtained more than 300 mln
  dlrs in financing for industrial projects and increased its
  lines of credit for import financing, finance minister Manuel
  Azpurua said.
      'We can say that we are achieving the recuperation of
  credit, but that cannot be done overnight,' Azpurua said in a
  television interview.
      He said a credit agreement for 100 mln marks will be signed
  this week with the German state bank Kreditanstalt fur
  Wiederaufbau (KFW), to finance an expansion of the state
  aluminum company Venalum.
      The credit will be divided into two separate agreements,
  one for 85 mln marks with an interest rate of 6.13 pct, and
  another for 15 mln marks, at 6.20 pct.
      Azpurua said financing has also been obtained for expansion
  of Alcasa, another state aluminum company, and for projects in
  the state steel and petrochemical industries.
      Yesterday, he said Venezuela obtained two new credits of
  5.0 mln dlrs each for export financing, one from Credit du Nord
  of France and the other from Britain's Midland Bank.
      The Venezuelan government has been criticised at home for
  failing to obtain new credits, despite its insistence on
  repaying foreign debt according to the terms of a rescheduling
  accord reached last February.
      Azpurua recently visited Tokyo hoping to acquire new
  credits for industrial expansions but clinched no agreements.
  Japanese officials refused to allow a new issue of Venezuelan
  bonds until the country regains its 'Triple A' credit rating.

"SPRINKEL URGES GREATER GROWTH IN JAPAN, EUROPE
  Beryl Sprinkel, chairman of
  the president's council of economic advisors, said stronger
  domestic demand growth in Japan and Western Europe is needed to
  help stimulate U.S. exports without having to rely on futher
  dollar declines.
      ""Stronger domestic demand growth in the major foreign
  industrial countries is needed to engender the much needed
  expansion of U.S. export markets without having to rely on
  further dollar depreciation,"" he told the Futures Industry
  Association.
      Sprinkel said the recent recovery of domestic demand in
  Japan and Europe has been one of the weakest in the post-war
  period.
      ""Stronger domestic demand growth in the major industrial
  countries would help give balance to the current world
  recovery,"" he said.
      Asked if Japan was not living up to commitments made last
  month to trading partners, he said recent figures showed
  Japan's economy grew by about 0.5 pct in the fourth quarter of
  1986, ""Not enough to sustain employment growth.""
      However, Sprinkel said Japan had not reneged on its pledges
  and was moving toward more stimulative policies, including tax
  reform. ""I suspect there will be further moves,"" he said.
      Sprinkel repeated his call for further cuts in U.S.
  government spending and for resistance to tax increases.
      ""Reducing the federal government budget deficit by
  expenditure restraint is needed to preserve the low marginal
  tax rates achieved by tax reform,"" he said, adding that ""a vote
  to increase to government expenditures is a vote against tax
  reform.""
      Sprinkel said the fall of the dollar had substantially
  restored U.S. cost competitiveness and that the deterioration
  of the U.S. trade balance appeared to have abated.
      However, he said that ""sole reliance on dollar depreciation
  to reduce our trade deficit is not desirable,"" as it risks
  inflation in the United States and recession abroad.
      ""I am confident that further improvements in our trade
  performance will contribute significantly to growth in 1987,"" he
  said. Improvements in the U.S. trade balance, he said, will
  come about largely from a swing in manufactures trade and
  present ""serious adjustment problems for U.S. trading partners.""
      Western Europe, where manufactures output and employment
  have been weak, promises to be especially hard hit by the
  improvement in the U.S. trade balance, Sprinkel said.
      He defended flexible exchange rates saying wide swings in
  rates were not a fault of the system but of the undesirable
  policies that produced them.

      In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the
  department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has
  reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels
  insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at
  around 98 dlrs per tonne.
       For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5
  mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the
  breakeven export price, it said.
      Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance
  payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated
  at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current
  year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the
  department said.
      In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and
  storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.
      But the department said the Australian Bureau of
  Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will
  drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in
  1989/90.
      The decline will result from low world grain prices leading
  to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.
  wheat exports, the department said.

"SOUTH AFRICA PROBLEMS REMAIN DESPITE DEBT PACT
  South Africa's new foreign debt
  agreement sparked a rally in local financial markets, but
  bankers and economists said the pact removes only one source of
  anxiety from a still depressed economy.
      ""We have not gone from 'no confidence' to 'full confidence'
  yet,"" commented one banker, who saw the agreement as having
  marginal influence on fundamental economic problems.
      Money market analysts cited the debt renegotiation as the
  main impetus behind increases today in both the commercial and
  financial rand.
      The commercial rand, used for current account transactions,
  rose 0.5 cts to 49 U.S. Cts while the financial rand jumped
  nearly two cts to 33 U.S. Cts.
      All equity and fixed investment flows of foreigners take
  place through the financial rand, which is considered the main
  barometer of South Africa's attractiveness to overseas
  investors.
      Analysts predicted the debt arrangement plus further gains
  in the gold price could push the commercial rand over 50 U.S.
  Cts and the financial rand to 35 cents in the next few weeks.
      They said the financial rand in particular was being driven
  by a tentative provision in the new debt agreement that could
  favorably affect the currency.
      Foreign creditors may get permission to convert loan
  balances and short-term claims into equity investments in South
  Africa.
      Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said the Reserve Bank
  was ""investigating the implications of such conversions in light
  of terms and restrictions of the financial rand system.""
      Du Plessis in disclosing the new agreement last night said
  the recent sharp rise in the financial rand was an example that
  ""some foreign investors are again taking a more realistic view
  of South Africa.""
      Terms of the debt agreement call for South Africa to repay
  1.42 billion dlrs of 13 billion dlrs of frozen debt over the
  next three years. The agreement extends a standstill
  arrangement, expiring June 30, that has been in place since
  August, 1985.
      Bankers said the repayment amounts essentially confirmed
  their private estimates and could be comfortably met by the
  monetary authorities.
      ""They (creditors) asked for the maximum amount and we
  offered the minimum,"" said one banking source, reacting to
  reports from London that creditors were hoping for larger
  repayments.
      Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said South Africa
  should have ""no difficulty whatsoever"" with the terms.
      Economists said the debt agreement would have no
  significant impact on economic problems continuing to face
  South Africa including high rates of inflation and
  unemployment, labour unrest and political uncertainty.
      Johannesburg Stock Exchange president Tony Norton, speaking
  yesterday before the debt agreement, said the economy was ""in
  bad shape"" and there was ""an awful lot of talk but little action""
  to cure serious problems.

"BP TO OFFER 7.4 BILLION DLRS FOR STANDARD SHARES
  British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> said it
  intended to make a tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard Oil
  Co &lt;SRD.N> it does not already own at 70 dlrs a share cash, for
  a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.
      The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc>
  unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The
  offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
  being tendered.
      BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
  on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
  advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and
  non-public information.
      Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down
  1-3/4 dlrs.
      BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
  last night's close.
      About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's
  own resources.
      The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from
  banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and
  partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The
  company said it was in the course of arranging these
  facilities.
      BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said that the group's
  investment in Standard was its largest single asset. Full
  ownership would enable investment and operating decisions to be
  made without the limitations of a minority interest.
      BP also believed the acquisition represented the optimum
  use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices
  were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
  investment.
      Walters added that it also felt that, due to management
  changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even
  in a lower oil price environment.
      Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs
  and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before
  tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.
      Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.
  One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
  should spend so much money buying a company it already
  controlled.
      BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard
  shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.
      It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
  the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to
  dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the
  1987/88 financial year, analysts said.
      Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
  that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would
  depend on the reaction of the markets.
      The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59
  pct from 20 pct currently, he said.
      However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not
  repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard
  returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from
  its cash flow -- were good.
      Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.
      Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
  make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
  production and its downstream activities would push it
  comfortably into surplus.
      BP initially took a stake in Standard following the
  discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had
  inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,
  which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude
  oil.
      The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management
  reorganisation of Standard in the past year.
      The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was
  now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
  tender offer, Spedding said.
      BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major
  balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
  received in the markets.
      The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially
  after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
  -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
  straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
  other sectors.

"PERU BEGINS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATIONING
  Peru will put into effect today a foreign
  exchange rationing system for imports designed to stop a slide
  in the country's international reserves, a government decree in
  the Official Gazette said.
      Under the system, importers will be required to present a
  bill from the foreign seller of goods and apply for a license
  for foreign exchange. The central bank will have 10 days to
  decide whether to issue the required foreign exchange.
      Net international reserves now total about 800 mln dlrs
  compared to 1.54 billion dlrs a year ago.
      The system will be effective until the end of 1988.
      A ceiling for foreign exchange availability will be set by
  a council with members from the central bank, the economy
  ministry and the planning and foreign trade institutes. The
  central bank will issue licenses to procure foreign exchange in
  accordance with guidelines set by the council.
      Peru's reserves fell sharply due to a drop in the trade
  surplus to about five mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.1 billion in
  1985, according to preliminary central bank estimates.

"ALLEGHENY BEVERAGE &lt;ABEV> EXPLORES UNIT SALE
  Allegheny Beverage Corp said it
  has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its
  foodservice unit, Service America Corp.
      The group includes senior management of Service America but
  no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said.
      The company has agreed to permit the group and its
  potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service
  America, it said.
      Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin
  off the foodservice subsidiary.
      The company said the group's review is preliminary and
  there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made
  or, if made, accepted.
      Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln
  dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of
  1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a
  spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said.
      He declined to identify the Service America officials in
  the acquisition group.
      On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin
  off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It
  said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America
  to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit.
      Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985,
  operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines.
  Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated
  laundry services, building maintenance services and retail
  office and furniture operations.
      In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing
  operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share,
  excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations
  and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985,
  Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc
  &lt;PEP> for 160 mln dlrs.

"SOVIET INDUSTRIAL GROWTH/TRADE SLOWER IN 1987
  The Soviet Union's industrial output is
  growing at a slower pace in 1987 than in 1986 and foreign trade
  has fallen, Central Statistical Office figures show.
      Figures in the Communist Party newspaper Pravda show
  industrial production rose 3.6 pct in the first nine months of
  1987 against 5.2 pct in the same 1986 period.
      Foreign trade in the same period fell 3.6 pct from the 1986
  period as exports fell by 0.5 pct and imports dropped by 4.2
  pct.
      Foreign trade in the nine months totalled 94.2 billion
  roubles. Separate import and export figures were not given.
      One factor affecting industrial growth was the introduction
  of a new quality control plan, Western economists said. Last
  year's calculations of industrial output included all goods,
  irrespective of quality.
      Under the new plan, introduced in line with Soviet leader
  Mikhail Gorbachev's drive to modernise the economy, special
  inspectors have the right to reject goods they consider below
  standard.
      Pravda said 42 mln roubles worth of defective goods were
  rejected in the nine-month period.
      The figures also showed that on October 1, there were more
  than 8,000 cooperative enterprises employing over 80,000
  people. More than 200,000 were employed in the private sector,
  Pravda said, without giving comparative figures.
      The promotion of the cooperative and private sectors of the
  economy has been an important part of the modernisation
  campaign, with measures introduced recently to allow the
  setting up of small shops on a private basis.
      Labour productivity rose 3.7 pct in the first nine months
  against 4.8 pct growth in January to September 1986.
      But western economists said they treat Soviet productivity
  figures with caution, as they are more broadly based than in
  the West, which measures worker output over a given period.
      Pravda said there were 283.8 mln people in the Soviet Union
  as of October 1. In the January to September 1987 period 118.5
  mln people were employed, a rise of 4.4 pct on the same period
  last year. Average earnings were 200 roubles a month against
  194 roubles a year ago.

"BANK OF ENGLAND PRESSURE HOLDS BASE RATES
  This week's Bank of England resistance to
  strong market pressure for lower interest rates succeeded in
  holding bank base rates at 11 pct.
      But at a cost of threatening the Chancellor of the
  Exchequer Nigel Lawson's policy, stated at the end of the Paris
  Group of Six meeting last month, that he wanted to see sterling
  broadly stable about then prevailing levels, market sources
  said.
      Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing
  trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the
  Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.
      Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.
      A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted
  a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is
  therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.
      Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe
  Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the
  trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. ""Even after this action
  over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking
  distance of that range,"" he said.
      Other analysts agree that the government probably has some
  broad target range around this area.
      However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the
  pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of
  a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.
      ""If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they
  are, what's to stop it (going higher),"" said John Cox, executive
  director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London
  foreign exchange market.
      Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active
  selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of
  general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped
  keep it below 1.60 dlrs.
      The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and
  1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.
      But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling
  heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it
  holds around these levels.
      He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest
  rate boat. ""If rates don't come down, the market will say they
  ought to have come down and will sell sterling,"" he said.
      Most dealers agree there is a good deal of ""hot money"" being
  invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight
  or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short
  notice.
      However, the authorities will hope that at least a
  proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.
      ""The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and
  have to jack them back up again,"" said Richard Jeffrey,
  economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.
      He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for
  sterling, at least in the near term.
      However, most analysts are still looking for a full point
  about March 17, Budget Day.
      The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the
  Budget, said Temperton.
      The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the
  run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current
  bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.
      ""Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget.
  He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate
  cut,"" said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the
  equities arm of Mercury International Group.
      Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the
  way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in
  the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last
  Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.
      This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11
  3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest
  since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.
      However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months
  money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut
  as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.

"U.S. ECONOMIC DATA KEY TO DEBT FUTURES OUTLOOK
  U.S. economic data this week could be
  the key in determining whether U.S. interest rate futures break
  out of a 3-1/2 month trading range, financial analysts said.
      Although market expectations are for February U.S. retail
  sales Thursday and industrial production Friday to show healthy
  gains, figures within or slightly below expectations would be
  positive for the market, the analysts said.
      ""You have to be impressed with the resiliency of bonds
  right now,"" said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig
  Sloane.
      Treasury bond futures came under pressure today which
  traders linked to a persistently firm federal funds rate and a
  rise in oil prices. However, when sufficient selling interest
  to break below chart support in the June contract failed to
  materialize, participants who had sold bond futures early
  quickly covered short positions, they said.
      ""Everyone is expecting strong numbers, and if they come in
  as expected it won't be that bad for the market,"" Sloane said.
      Sloane said the consensus estimate for the non-auto sector
  of retail sales is for a rise of 0.6 to 0.7 pct.
      Dean Witter analyst Karen Gibbs said a retail sales figure
  below market forecasts would give a boost to debt futures, and
  she put the range for the non-auto sector of retail sales at up
  0.8 to 1.2 pct.
      Industrial production and the producer price index Friday
  both are expected to show increases of about 0.5 pct, she
  added.
      Retail sales ""will tell us whether or not we will be able
  to fill the gap,"" Gibbs said, referring to a chart gap in June
  bonds between 100-26/32 and 101-3/32 created Friday. June bonds
  closed at 100-4/32 today.
      Also key to debt futures direction, in addition to the
  federal funds rate, is the direction of crude oil prices, said
  Carroll McEntee and McGinley Futures analyst Brian Singer.
      ""A higher fed funds rate and firm oil prices precluded the
  market from breaking out of the trading range the last time the
  market approached the top of the range,"" Singer said.
      In order for bonds to break above the top of the range,
  which is just below 102 in the June contract, ""the crude oil
  rally needs to run its course and pull back a little bit,""
  Singer said. ""Fed funds are already easing back down toward the
  six pct level.""
      The recent surge in oil prices has also been a concern to
  Manufacturers Hanover Futures analyst Jim Rozich, but the rally
  may be nearing a top around 18.50 dlrs per barrel, he said.
      Rozich said he is looking for the June bond contract to
  ease to 99-6/32 and find support.
      ""I'm not quite ready to jump on the bullish bandwagon yet.
  The jury is still out this week,"" Rozich said.

"CRS SIRRINE &lt;DA> TO TAKE WRITE-OFF
  CRS Sirrine Inc said it plans a major
  restructuring of its balance sheet that will include a
  write-off of between 39 mln and 43 mln dlrs, most of which
  would be intangible goodwill from the company's past
  acquisitions.
      The company said the remainder of its write-off would
  include a one-time expense for future costs related to early
  retirement programs, office consolidations and an increase in
  the general reserve for adjustments and contingencies.
      Bruce Wilkinson, president of the company, said the charges
  to the company's third quarter earnings, for the period ending
  March 31, would ""significantly impact"" third quarter results
  but would not affect the company's cash position.
      ""We expect to have the biggest operating backlog in the
  company's history by June 30, 1987, the end of our fiscal
  year,"" Wilkinson said. ""We believe the action being proposed
  will begin to contribute to improved earnings in the fourth
  quarter of our fiscal 1987 and throughout fiscal 1988.""
      The company, which is one of the nation's largest
  construction firms, also said termination of its defined
  benefit retirement plan would produce a pre-tax benefit of
  about 10 mln dlrs due to overfunding of the plan.

"SWIRE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH THIS YEAR
  Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> expects
  continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees
  problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.
      He told reporters:""1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific
  Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire
  Properties expects further good results both from properties
  under development for sale and from its investment property
  portfolio.""
      He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The
  company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78
  billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.
      Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs
  mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific
  Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>.
      Miles said the company will use the money to develop its
  business, primarily in Hong Kong.
      Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from
  70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25
  pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the
  enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust
  and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986
  profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.
      Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's
  flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.
      He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of ""a
  marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with
  savings in fuel costs.""
      ""At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable
  for the rest of this year,"" he said, ""though there might be a bit
  of increase later this year.''
      Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service
  operations, even though the marine sector is generally
  depressed. ""Obviously the marine industry is not getting any
  better,"" he said.
      The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year
  revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with
  an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.
      Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm
  but said the firm has no available land for a major housing
  project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong
  island now near completion.
      He said the company's 50 pct unit &lt;Hongkong United Dockyard
  Ltd> is negotiating with the government for the development of
  an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing
  estate. ""But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing,"" he said.

"EC EXTENDS PARTS OF FREE FOOD FOR POOR SCHEME
  A scheme to distribute surplus food
  free to the poor in the European Community (EC), which was due
  to expire next Tuesday, will be partially extended for a
  further month, an EC Commission spokesman said.
      He added the executive Commission has not yet decided
  whether the scheme should become a permanent feature of the
  EC's struggle to find a use for its massive stocks of farm
  produce.
      Almost 60,000 tonnes of cereals, sugar, beef, butter and
  other food have been authorised for distribution under an
  operation sanctioned by EC farm ministers on January 20 in
  which charities act as executive Commission agents.
      The original idea was to help the needy survive this year's
  unusually cold European winter.
      The spokesman said the Commission was extending the scheme
  fully in Greece, which has recently been hit by unseasonal
  snowstorms, for the month of April.
      Other EC countries would be authorised to use stocks of
  food for which they have already applied under the scheme up to
  April 30. The spokesman said this would enable distribution of
  flour, semolina, sugar and olive oil at a relatively high rate
  next month.
      He said the Commission, which has powers to continue most
  aspects of the scheme without consulting ministers further,
  will be considering soon whether it should be made permanent.
      Cost, which has already reached around 65 mln European
  currency units, would be a major consideration.
      End-January stocks included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter,
  520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.

"TIME &lt;TL> 1987 EARNINGS MAY BE 4.25 DLRS SHARE
  Time Inc's chief financial officer,
  Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is
  ""comfortable"" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings
  will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share.
      In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,
  including a number of special items.
      Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special
  items and also removing the earnings of American Television and
  Communications Corp &lt;ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in
  1986.
      Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the
  cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly
  in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in
  Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest.
      Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a
  Turner Broadcasting spokesman said.
      Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously
  announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back
  4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were
  purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of
  81 dlrs per share.
      Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback
  program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term
  investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not
  give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln
  shares already announced.
     
      On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and
  chief executive said the company is not interested in investing
  in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all
  areas in which it is currently engaged.
      Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time.
  In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest
  acquisition ever.
      N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
  the company might be interested in a relatively small book
  business.
      He said following the recent agreement for the sale of
  Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd &lt;NWS>, ""there may be pieces
  that Murdoch doesn't want,"" referring to News Corp chairman
  Rupert Murdoch.
      Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munro
  said it is a ""delicate subject"", and ""we're looking at all the
  options."" SAMI is a marketing information service for the food
  industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as
  much as 500 mln dlrs.
     
      Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscribers
  last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of
  1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will be
  down slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a
  special gain in the HBO unit.
      Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber
  growth of 800,000 for last year.
      He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under
  50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and
  higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the
  tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points.
      Munro said the company does not plan to increase its
  dividend.
      Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of American
  Television and Communications, said the unit is looking at
  getting involved in the home shopping video area. ""It would be
  foolish not to be a player there,"" he said.
      He said the company had talks with Home Shopping Network
  Inc &lt;HSN> prior to that company's public offering last year,
  but nothing came of the talks.

"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS
  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

"AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT CO COUNTER-BIDS FOR TMOC
  &lt;The Australian Gas Light Co> (AGL) said it
  will offer one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in
  oil and gas producer &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> in a counter-bid to
  the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>.
      The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on
  AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped
  to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price
  of 4.15.
      The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year,
  compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.
      Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL
  offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares.
      AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of
  TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of
  3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.
      &lt;Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about
  three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share
  on-market offer that has since lapsed.
      AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of
  values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response
  urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid.
      AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible
  notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in
  AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue.
      It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice
  Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses
  complementary with those of AGL.
      AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC
  has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it
  owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where
  it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field. It
  also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines.

"UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT
  A half point cut in base lending rates
  was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the
  Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of
  downward pressure, dealers said.
      During its routine intervention in the market, the bank
  trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by
  half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing
  banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.
      The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by
  surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen
  hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.
         For some time, fundamentals have
  led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending
  rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow
  wholesale money market rates down.
      Although political considerations -- the government's wish
  to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had
  been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's
  delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling
  and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the
  Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers
  said.
      In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut,
  leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.
      Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the
  day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to
  10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at
  10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between
  5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.
      Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at
  around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the
  end of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some
  11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated
  300 mln stg shortage.

  likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister
  of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters.
      Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference,
  blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and
  demand. ""If we stick to the production limitation, the third
  quarter will be in better balance.""
      He said the market is in a period of transition while the
  impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix
  prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.
      Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
  (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude
  oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices,
  Subroto said: ""Apparently they have taken care of that.""
      ""They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think
  they'll help each other,"" he said.
      Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price
  Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had
  been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.
      ""Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting
  because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices,"" he said.

"U.S. BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS
  Problems in the farmbelt and
  oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall
  income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit
  Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.
      The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8
  billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1
  billion dlrs.
      The total was still the second highest ever reported, but
  it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.
      The figures reflected a radical split in the health of
  banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.
      In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while
  one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.
      Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC
  said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles
  it planned to issue.
      ""I don't remember a time when there was such a clear
  distinction by geographic area,"" FDIC Chairman William Seidman
  told reporters.
      He said that while the figures were not good, they showed
  the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but
  with regional differences in economic performance.
      Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many
  as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted
  the pace would continue. 
      On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208
  billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the
  number of new problem banks in all regions except the
  Southwest, Seidman said.
      Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth
  quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a
  year ago.
      Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or
  more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC
  said.
      Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's
  moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.
      He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom
  to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be
  expected.
      But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant
  other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger,
  Seidman said.

  previous year.
      ""We were looking for 1.15 dlrs,"" said an analyst at a major

  of the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at its

  Ames. ""We do not have hard evidence we are still putting things

      He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it
  was the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline in

"U.K. LENDERS OFFER MORE FIXED RATE MORTGAGES
  More U.K. Lenders are offering homebuyers
  fixed interest rate mortgages under which the borrower makes
  the same monthly payment no matter what happens to other
  interest rates.
      And with mortgage rates now at their lowest levels in
  years, the loans have been snapped up by eager home buyers
  trying to lock into cheap money.
      The decision to offer fixed rate loans, industry officials
  said, reflects the increasingly competitive nature of the home
  mortgage business.
      While fixed rate mortgages are uncommon in the U.K., They
  were the mainstay of the business in the U.S. Up until only a
  few years ago.
      But in the early 1980s interest rates soared. U.S. Lenders,
  mostly savings and loan associations, were earning rates as low
  as three pct on 30 year fixed rate mortgages they held in their
  portfolios but had to pay depositors rates as high as 15 pct to
  induce them to retain their accounts.
      As a result hundreds of institutions collapsed or were
  forced to merge. The survivors decided to offer mortgages whose
  rates would move in line with the cost of funds.
      ""We very much have the example of the U.S. Thrifts in mind,""
  said a spokesman for Abbey National Building Society,
  explaining why his institution, for the time being, is only
  offering variable rate mortgages.
      The rash of advertising to solicit new business has helped
  homebuyers to become even choosier about loans and lenders
  concede they are being forced to undercut each other still
  more.
      Sharp cuts on variable rate mortgages announced earlier
  this week by the nation's two largest building societies and by
  National Westminster Bank Plc reflect growing competition for
  new business, officials at all three institutions said.
      The fixed rate mortgages on offer carry interest rates even
  below those on the variable rate loans.
      ""Of course they are less profitable than other (variable
  rate) mortgages,"" said a spokesman for Midland Bank Plc, which
  earlier this year said it earmarked 500 mln dlrs for fixed rate
  new mortgage loans.
      But he said the bank is willing to offer less profitable
  loans because, ""It was just another way to attract people to our
  mortgage product.""
      Trustee Savings Bank Plc (TSB) was offering five year fixed
  rate mortgages at 9.9 pct earlier this year.
      The 100 mln stg that TSB set aside for the loans was
  exhausted within just a few days, according to a spokeswoman.
      ""Everybody loves an under 10 pct mortgage,"" she said, noting
  that within five days the bank loaned the equivalent of 25 pct
  of its 1986 volume.
      In short, the appeal of fixed rate mortgages is that they
  offer an opportunity to gamble on the direction of interest
  rates. If interest rates fall after the mortgage is made the
  lender is earning an above average return on assets.
      But if interest rates rise it is the homebuyer who has won
  the benefit of cheap money.
      Household Mortgage Co had planned to offer a 25 year fixed
  rate mortgage after the June 11 elections on the assumption
  that a Conservative Party victory would help money market rates
  fall further, according to Duncan Young, managing director.
      Young explained that the company had planned to protect
  itself against the chance of rising interest rates by buying a
  complicated hedging instrument.
      But money market rates have risen contrary to expectations
  and the company has shelved its plans for the time being. He
  said money market rates were too high to arrange both the
  mortgages and hedge profitably.
      However, he said that when the Household Mortgage Co does
  make fixed rate mortgages it is likely to securitise them. This
  means bundling different mortgages together to resemble a bond
  and selling them to an investor.
      For technical reasons securitisation is simpler and more
  efficient with fixed rate rather than with floating rate
  mortgages. In the U.S., Where fixed rate mortgages are popular
  again, securitisation has provided the bulk of mortgage money
  over the past few years.

"TALKS FAIL TO END BRAZILIAN SEAMEN'S STRIKE
  Pay talks aimed at ending a
  week-old national seamen's strike collapsed today and the
  strike will continue, a union official said.
      The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships
  in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of
  the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters.
      The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have
  rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company
  Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of
  Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma).
      Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro
  with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without
  resolving the dispute.
      He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands,
  Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.
      Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to
  the government, which has suspended interest payments on part
  of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in
  the country's trade balance.
      The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo
  Rubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strike
  continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport
  Brazilian exports.

"(CORRECTED) - MOBIL &lt;MOB> TO UPGRADE REFINERY UNIT
  Mobil Corp said it will spend over 30
  mln dlrs to upgrade a gasoline-producing unit at its Beaumont,
  Texas, refinery.
      It said the unit is a catalytic reformer, which converts
  low-octane components of gasoline into high-octane components
  for use in Super Unleaded gasoline.
      The company said the modernization will allow the unit to
  regenerate catalysts on a continuous basis without shutdown.
  Currently, it must be shut twice a year.  The unit produces
  46,000 barrels of gasoline components a day.  Construction will
  start late this year, with completion set for mid-1989.

"RECENT SUGAR FALL SPARKS SOVIET, CHINESE BUYING
  The recent fall in world sugar prices,
  due to increased producer pricing sales and evidence of export
  availability, has encouraged renewed buying interest from China
  and the Soviet Union, London trade house E.D.And F. Man said.
      Further purchases are expected by the Peoples Republic of
  China at the lower end of the recent price range, which should
  limit the downside movement, it said in its latest monthly
  market report.
     ""And it is believed that the Soviet Union will need to return
  to the market to take a further 250,000/350,000 tonnes for
  May/June shipment, Man added.
      The Soviets purchased five cargoes of raws for April/May
  shipment towards the end of last month, which brings its total
  purchases to around 1.65 mln tonnes, Man said.
      Production estimates for the Thai crop now exceed 2.3 mln
  tonnes and the final outturn appears set to reach around 2.5
  mln tonnes. However, this upturn in the Thai crop is being
  countered by a reduction in China's production forecast to 5.3
  mln tonnes from 5.5 mln estimated earlier.
      Market participation by Cuba suggests that its crop could
  be close to last year's 7.3 mln tonnes. But even with similar
  production Man expects Cuban exports to be significantly down.
      Cuba was reported to be carrying 1.3 mln tonnes of stocks
  in September 1985, of which some 440,000 tonnes were used to
  boost its 1985/86 exports to about 6.9 mln. But as it will not
  be able to draw on surplus stocks this year, Man estimates
  Cuba's export availabilty will be reduced to 6.4 to 6.5 mln
  tonnes.
      However, Cuba is only one of a large number of exporters
  with reduced availability, Man said.
      Since 1980 the total free market export supply has fallen
  to 18 mln from about 22 mln tonnes. But at the same time free
  market demand has also fallen by almost the same amount, which
  has left exporters chasing falling import requirements.
      A fairly tight balance now appears to have emerged. But the
  difficult task of keeping production advances at bay still
  remains, as at least one more season of production deficit is
  needed to eliminate some of the remaining surplus stocks still
  overhanging the market, Man said.
      The increasing cases of record production as a result of
  record yields and better husbandry have forced sugar producers
  to strive for greater efficiency.
      As this increase in efficiency reduces the marginal cost of
  production, sugar exporters may become more responsive to
  prices and in particular to upward price movements, Man said.
      Commenting on the current row between the EC Commission and
  sugar producers, Man said despite the recent improvement in the
  level of restitutions, they are still insufficient to fully
  compensate producers when exporting on the world market.
      Unless there are further improvements, at least some sugar
  is expected to remain in intervention, it added.

"ZAMBIA, IMF TALKS HIT PROBLEMS OVER FOOD SUBSIDIES
  Zambia's talks with the World Bank and
  International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a financial rescue package
  have run into difficulties on the issue of food subsidies, an
  official newspaper said.
      The Times of Zambia, which is run by the ruling United
  National Independence Party (UNIP), quoted official sources as
  saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing
  food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how
  it proposes to pay for them.
      President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies
  last December, in line with IMF recommendations, but the move
  caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots
  in which 15 people were killed.
      The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to
  quell the disturbances, but they are estimated to cost the
  government about 500 mln kwacha per year.
      The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the
  government's current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the
  remodelling of Zambia's foreign exchange auction.
      The central bank's weekly auction of foreign exchange to
  the private sector has been suspended since the end of January,
  pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and
  dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.
      The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction
  system, losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months. However, since
  the end of January it has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine
  per dollar.
      Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank
  and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar
  on the currency's devaluation once the auctions restart.
      According to the Times of Zambia, the IMF team, led by
  assistant director for Africa Paul Acquah, is due to conclude
  its talks with the government on schedule on March 23.
      The IMF mission arrived in Lusaka on February 26 and its
  talks with the government have taken longer than expected.

  moves in the same direction for two consecutive sessions,
  according to the CSCE announcement.
      Before the rule change today, the CSCE required two days of
  limit moves in the first three restricted contracts before
  expanding the daily trading limit.
      Under new guidelines, if the first two restricted
  deliveries move the 6.0 cent limit for two days the Exchange
  will expand the limit. The expanded 9.0 cent limit will remain
  in effect until the settling prices on both of the first two
  limited months has not moved by more than the normal 6.0 cent
  limit for other contracts in two successive trading sessions,

"EC COULD DECIDE ON JAPAN TRADE MOVES IN LATE MAY
  The European Community (EC) has
  effectively given Japan six weeks to take moves to open its
  market to imports before it decides on possible tough
  retaliatory trade measures, EC diplomats said.
      They said EC foreign ministers will meet on May 25 and 26
  to review the state of trade relations between the two sides.
      The EC executive commission was asked by representatives of
  member states on Friday to propose a renunciation of some EC
  pledges to the world trade body, GATT, unless there are
  ""adequate and early measures to open the Japanese market.""
      Such a renunciation would be the first step to imposing
  stiff increases in duties, or quantitative limits, on Japanese
  exports.
      The diplomats said it was unlikely that the issue would be
  discussed in detail at the next meeting of EC foreign ministers
  on April 27 and 28 in Luxembourg as time was needed to prepare
  proposals for possible retaliatory action.
      They said the commission has powers to take some limited
  action before getting ministerial approval to prevent Japanese
  exports of electrical, photographic and other goods being
  diverted to Europe following of possible U.S. Tariff moves.
      In May, the ministers are also likely to discuss how to
  prevent Japan from getting an extra trading advantage as a
  result of Spain and Portugal joining the bloc, which obliges
  them gradually to reduce tariffs on many industrial goods.
      Japan's trade surplus with the Community has grown
  steadily, registering a record 2.13 billion dlrs in March.

"CHINA CLOSES SECOND ROUND OF OFFSHORE OIL BIDS
  China has closed the second round of
  bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights,
  the China Daily has reported.
      It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil
  Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15
  foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south
  Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.
      Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one
  well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km
  south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day.
  The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.
      The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts
  for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did
  not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not
  be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.
      China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37
  companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore
  exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were
  terminated after no oil was discovered.

"AUSTRALIAN PLANS PHILIPPINE BRANCH FOR TAKEOVER
  The Australia based &lt;Ariadne
  Australia Ltd>, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to
  fulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippine
  brewing firm, &lt;San Miguel Corp>, a Hong Kong newspaper said.
      The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of
  Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that &lt;Barwon
  Farmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns
  a 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines.
      He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a
  total 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares.
      Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San
  Miguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons
  spokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be
  sold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines.
      He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government
  which seized the block of shares from the United Coconut
  Planters Bank, which is believed to be linked with the
  country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
      He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon
  and the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only
  offer in cash, the newspaper reported.
      Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours
  that &lt;Neptunia Corp>, a Hong Kong registered company which
  controlled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano, is the
  other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares.
      The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled last
  May against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel
  shares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman Eduardo
  Cojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut.
      Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government
  would not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, adding
  San Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties.
      The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent
  yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman,
  New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent
  to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares
  from the government.
      ""Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the
  Philippines' yearly budget,"" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo
  Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.
      Spokesmen of Ariadne, Jacksons and Neptunia were not
  available for comment, nor any officials of the Philippines.
      &lt;San Miguel Brewery Ltd>, a Hong Kong listed company which
  is 69.65 pct held by Neptunia on behalf of San Miguel Corp,
  closed 40 cents higher at 15.50 H.K. Dlrs on Friday.

"CASH CRISIS HITS UGANDAN COFFEE BOARD
  Uganda's state-run Coffee Marketing
  Board (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two
  months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and
  administrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.
      The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the
  equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and
  processors for coffee already delivered, but its present export
  revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.
      The board's cash crisis has serious implications for the
  economy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of
  Uganda's total exports.
      The CMB's financial difficulties first started in January
  following delays in rail-freighting export consignments of
  coffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.
      These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in
  Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan
  wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and
  Tanzanian railway systems, the sources said
      Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly
  acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to
  local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for
  moving exports.
      Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze
  would be resolved in two weeks.
      However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between
  the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out
  of action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh
  delays in cargo movements.
      Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption
  of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned
  their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.
      Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB
  was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.
      These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda's
  expected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September)
  crop, the sources said.
      According to the sources, the board's financial problems
  have been aggravated by long delays in processing export
  receipts.
      The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle
  export receipts into payments to local producers, whereas
  export bills handled by local banks took half that time to
  process, they said.
      The sources said the CMB's price structure had been
  overtaken by Uganda's high inflation rate, unofficially
  estimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further
  disincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.
      ""The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months
  behind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the
  sooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the
  better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,"" one
  of the sources said.
      The government is currently negotiating a package of
  economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary
  Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to
  help Uganda's economic recovery after 15 years of political
  strife.

"RUBBER LEAF DISEASE SEEN AFFECTING SUPPLY/PRICES
  The leaf disease corenes pora,
  which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and
  Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up
  depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said.
      Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved
  and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection
  and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of
  Malaysia (RRIM), told Reuters.
      He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes
  pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may cause
  output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.
      The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute
  may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the
  disease and added that most estates affected belong to the
  State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.
      Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects
  certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that
  further use of such clones must be discontinued.
      Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research
  Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444,
  2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said.
      Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725
  clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed
  after use of such clones were discontinued.
      Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also
  affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience
  has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added.
      ""The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is not
  curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may
  drop and prices can rise,"" he said.
      He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak in
  Sri Lanka and was monitoring the situation.

      They said the agreement followed months of talks with the
  Soviet Union and the U.S. On ways to secure its oil exports
  after Iran started to attack Kuwaiti-connected vessels in
  retaliation for Kuwait's backing for Iran's war enemy Iraq.
      Diplomats said they expect three Soviet tankers initially

      They said Soviet cargo ships bound for Kuwait in the past
  to unload arms and materiel for road delivery to Iraq were
  known to have sailed under escort. So far, none of the Soviet

"U.S./SOVIET GRAIN MEETING UNLIKELY THIS SUMMER
  Prospects appear slim for a summer
  meeting between U.S. and Soviet officials before the two
  countries enter the final year of their bilateral grains
  agreement, Agriculture Department officials said.
      The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the
  agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up
  to last February. However, any delay this year should not
  endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends
  through September, 1988, USDA officials said.
      ""It will be difficult to pull together the people for the
  meeting during July,"" an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel
  Amstutz said.
      Since the last meeting was only around four months ago, the
  next talks could still be a ""couple more months,"" he said.
     
      There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA
  will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next
  marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations
  were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.
      ""I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer
  or before the next agreement year begins,"" a USDA source said.

  year's crops, he said, ""There are too many variables now. It
  would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.""
      Under the nonbinding pact, Moscow has agreed to purchase a
  minimum of nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain per year. Soviet and

"COCOA DELEGATES OPTIMISTIC ON BUFFER STOCK RULES
  Hopes mounted for an agreement on cocoa
  buffer stock rules at an International Cocoa Organization,
  ICCO, council meeting which opened here today, delegates said.
      Both producer and consumer ICCO members said after the
  opening session that prospects for an agreement on the cocoa
  market support mechanism were improving.
      ""The chances are very good as of now of getting buffer stock
  rules by the end of next week,"" Ghanaian delegate and producer
  spokesman Mama Mohammed told journalists.
      Consumer spokesman Peter Baron called the tone of the
  negotiations ""optimistic and realistic.""
      The ICCO council failed to agree on buffer stock rules when
  a new International Cocoa Agreement came into force in January,
  with deep differences of opinion precluding serious discussions
  on the matter at that time. The existing buffer stock of about
  100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen, with a funds balance of 250
  mln dlrs.
      The ICCO made buffer stock rules negotiations a priority at
  this semi-annual council meeting in order to stop the slide in
  world cocoa prices.
      Consumers and producers agreed yesterday on the principles
  as a basis for negotiations.
      The council broke for lunch, and reconvenes at 1500 hrs. A
  working group which has been meeting since Monday will tackle
  the buffer stock rules issue again at 1600 hrs, when ICCO
  executive director Kobena Erbynn presents a fleshed-out version
  of a draft proposal he prepared earlier this week, delegates
  said.
      Mohammed said delegates will have a much clearer indication
  of prospects for an accord after details of the rules are
  elaborated by Erbynn, and after producers and consumers meet
  separately later today to examine the scheme.
      The draft proposal included three principles: a limit to
  non- member cocoa comprising the buffer stock, an offer system
  for buying buffer stock cocoa, and price differentials to be
  paid for various cocoas making up the buffer stock, delegates
  said.
      During the morning council session, the Ivory Coast
  delegation gave ""an open minded statement"" that it is willing to
  work out a buffer stock rules solution which could come into
  effect as soon as possible, Baron said.
      Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon, chairman of
  the ICCO council, was now expected to arrive in London Monday
  to attend the talks, Baron said. Vice chairman Sir Denis Henry
  of Grenada chaired the meeting in his place.
      Soviet and East German delegates did not attend the council
  session because of a conflicting International Sugar
  Organization meeting today, but could arrive this afternoon,
  delegates said.

"JAPAN BEEF PRICE SUPPORT CUT WILL NOT RAISE DEMAND
  Japan's plan to cut beef intervention
  prices for the fiscal year starting April 1 will not boost
  demand because of strict supply controls and a complex
  distribution system, Japanese and U.S. Industry sources said.
      ""Government beef policy protects farmers rather than meeting
  consumers' demands and the cutback ... Is too marginal,"" a
  Housewives Association of Japan official said.
      Despite mounting U.S. Pressure on Japan to open farm
  markets, beef is strictly controlled by the government, which
  maintains a price stabilisation zone to protect farmers.
      Under the plan, expected to be announced this month, the
  standard or bottom price of castrated wagyu -- known as marbled
  beef -- will be set at 1,370 yen per kilo for 1987/88 against
  1,400 now, and the ceiling at 1,780 yen against 1,820.
      The standard price of other beef, mainly produced from
  dairy steers, is set at 1,020 yen against 1,090 and the ceiling
  at 1,325 against 1,420.
      Ministry officials said the semi-government Livestock
  Industry Promotion Corp (LIPC) conducts buffer stock operations
  to help keep wholesale beef prices within the intervention
  price zone.
      The LIPC is allowed to import most beef, with the amount
  set by the government under a quota system. When wholesale
  prices go above the ceiling, the LIPC releases its beef stocks,
  both domestic and imported, and buys locally produced beef when
  prices are below.
      But the LIPC has often been criticised for releasing beef
  stocks when the prices are higher than the ceiling.
      Phillip Seng, Asian Director of the U.S. Meat Export
  Federation, told Reuters the two pct cut in prices is a step
  toward closing the gap with European Community prices, about
  half those in Japan.
      But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.
  Meat exporters because of Japan's rigid and complicated
  distribution system and strict supply control by the LIPC.
      The Housewives Association official said retail beef prices
  are high mainly because of distribution problems and high
  production costs, as well as poor operations by the LIPC.
      American meat packers see Japan as a promising market. F.C.
  Beatty, of U.S. Packer John Morrell and Co, told the Japan
  Times beef cuts, which sell for 1.20 to 3.00 dlrs a pound in
  the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.
      But Seng said the cut will not benefit consumers or U.S.

  the U.S., Are sold at 15 to 30 dlrs in Japan.
      But industry sources said it is unclear how much demand
  will pick up if retail beef prices drop following any sharp
  reduction in intervention prices.
      U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said this week he
  will ask Japan to remove all beef import restrictions when he
  visits here next month.
      In 1984, Japan decided to increase its beef import quota by
  9,000 tonnes a year until March 31, 1988.
      In 1987/88, the quota will rise to 177,000 tonnes from
  168,000 in 1986/87, ministry officials said, adding Japan wants
  to keep self-sufficiency in beef at around 70 pct.

"TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA>
  A bidding war for Viacom International
  Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
  management group and other investors against National
  Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
      Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
  close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
  side. He said if outside directors approve the management
  proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
  with proxy material going out late this week. ""It would take 20
  days from the day we mail,"" said the source.
      The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
  investor Sumner Redstone, would need ""half a year"" to complete
  a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
  accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
  and cable television franchises.
      Redstone was not available for comment.
      Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
  situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
  said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
  if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
  the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
      The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
  meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
      Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
  major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. ""We think
  we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,"" said the firm's
  arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
      Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
  create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
  management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
  billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
  stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
      Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
  a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
  value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
  stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
  interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
  the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
  total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
      Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
  preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
  convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
  was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
      Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
  would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
  April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
  plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
  during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
  eight pct interest.
      Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
  group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
  were offering high prices. ""Redstone really wants to own the
  company,"" one said. Another said management seemed to have the
  edge on the timing issue.
      Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
      A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
  the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
  noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which
  adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
  traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
  just over 30 dlrs.
      Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
  two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
  from several acquisitions affected results.
      Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to
  31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
  mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
  37.50 dlrs.
      Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,
  rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
      Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS>.
  The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates
  nine satellite television services and owns television and
  radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films
  and other programs for television.

"U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES
  From April through December 1986,
  the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs
  worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not
  been exchanged by January 1, 1987, the U.S. Agriculture
  Department said.
      The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in
  certificates has been authorized for issuance during
  January-August, 1987.
      These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn
  and wheat for the remainder of the crop year, the department
  said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.
      Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain
  more competitive on world markets, it said.
      The department said last summer, for example, certificates
  were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped
  increase marketable supplies, so farm-level corn prices
  averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they
  would have otherwise.
      The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40
  to 50 mln bushels, it said.
      The department said government spending on farm programs in
  fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from
  1986's 25.8 billion dlrs.
      During 1988 and 1989, the cost escalation of the first half
  of the 1980's will reverse. If current policy remains in force,
  annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last
  year's record by more than eight billion dlrs, it said.
      The department said the President's budget proposals for
  1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24
  billion dlrs.
      In 1987, foreign economic growth is expected to remain
  close to 2.6 pct, the same as in 1986, but above the 2.4 pct
  average of 1980-86, it said.
      Partially because of this improvement, U.S. export volume
  is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven
  years, the department said.

"RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP
  Good rains of one to four inches in the
  past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in
  the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an
  Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.
      As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a
  severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since
  December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet
  season.
      Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are
  beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth
  since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.
      Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better
  than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman
  said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain
  is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.
      Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region
  and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and
  some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.
      Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled
  towards the end of May, he said.
      The cane crush normally runs from June to December.

"SOVIET MINISTER SAYS TRADE BOOST UP TO FRENCH
  Soviet first deputy prime minister
  Vsevolod Murakhovsky said at the end of a brief visit here his
  country wanted to boost joint business with France, but that a
  reduction of France's trade deficit with the Soviet Union
  depended on the French.
      Murakhovsky, who is also chairman of the State
  Agro-Industrial Committee (GOSAGROPROM), told a news conference
  he had discussed a variety of possible deals with French
  companies Rhone-Poulenc, Pechiney and Imec.
      Declining to put figures on possible contracts he said he
  had discussed plant protection and the processing of highly
  sulphuric gas with Rhone-Poulenc, packaging technology for
  agricultural products with Pechiney, and fruit and vegetable
  juice processing with Imec.
      An official for Pechiney said an agreement of intent on
  packaging could be signed soon, but could not give any other
  details. The other two companies were not immediately available
  for comment.
      Asked whether he foresaw a reduction this year of France's
  trade shortfall, at 7.6 billion francs in the first 11 months
  of 1986 against 5.1 billion for the whole of 1985, Murakhovsky
  told Reuters: ""It all depends on France.""
      At a meeting in Paris last January French and Soviet
  foreign trade ministers said they were committed to increased
  efforts to reduce the deficit. Estimates at the time showed a
  French 190 mln franc surplus for December 1986.
      Murakhovsky said the Soviet Union was prepared to talk with
  anybody with ""interesting"" proposals offering latest technology
  and assuring ""a mutual advantage.""
      He said the Soviet Union had many tasks ahead of it and
  would deal rapidly with proposals it considered interesting.
      He encouraged companies to take advantage of new laws
  guaranteeing ""the interests of foreign partners"" in joint
  ventures.
      But he said no agreements had yet been finalised under the
  new joint venture laws.
      He said concrete deals had not yet been finalised as a
  result of a one billion dollar accord signed in Moscow last
  month with French businessman Jean-Baptiste Doumeng.
      He said Doumeng's Interagra company was preparing proposals
  for further examination by the Soviet Union. Doumeng last month
  said the agreement was to exchange one billion dollars worth of
  goods.
      Murakhovsky said the agreement was one of intent, and
  designed primarily to renew and increase the Soviet Union's
  food production capacity.

  ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc  has

  pharmaceutical company, Chairman Milan Panic said.
      At the company's annual meeting, he said an acquisition
  could take place in the next 24 months.
      ""The company has nearly two billion dlrs available for
  acquisition today,"" Panic said, adding, ""We are investigating a
  number of companies."" One company being studied could possibly
  be acquired on a friendly basis, he said.
      Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today to
  repurchase up to three mln ICN common shares.
      Discussing the possibility of an acquisition, Panic said
  the such a purchase is necessary because ICN's current
  marketing capability would not be sufficient to support
  distribution of the company's products, given ICN's
  expectations for market growth worldwide.
      ICN's principal product is ribavirin, also known as
  Virazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries and
  described as a broad-based anti-viral.
      The company has said its possible applications include
  treatment of some types of hepatitis, herpes, influenza,
  childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers.
      ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention in
  recent months because of Virazole, which has undergone clinical
  trials as a possible treatment of some AIDS-related diseases.
      Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regard
  to AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes its
  review of data submitted by the company.
      He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by a
  House Subcommittee is continuing.
      The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they are
  conducting separate investigations to determine whether or not
  ICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.
      Virazole is approved for marketing in the U.S. in aerosol

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS
  More U.S. And European firms will be
  falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and
  eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to
  merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.
      Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.
  Banks, steel and other businesses.
      In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's
  biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild
  Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies
  components for supercomputers.
      Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co
  Ltd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking
  a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the
  country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas
  banking, the takeover specialists said.
      Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating
  in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all
  have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.
      Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most
  pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto
  makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.
      ""The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up
  potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --
  Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,"" a
  takeover specialist at one trading company said.
      Japanese companies have become among the world's richest
  after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed
  against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.
      But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of
  Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into
  its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,
  the specialists said.
      Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more
  barriers against Japanese exports.
      Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid
  the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.
  Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little
  investment opportunity.
      ""Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but
  the recent economic factors have become a driving force,"" said a
  banking industry source.
      So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.
      While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in
  the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have
  totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.
      Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese
  acquisition activity was originally expected five years from
  now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.
      Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.
      A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals
  Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.
  Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he
  added.
      Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for
  550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid
  for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire
  business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all
  but its graphic arts-related businesses.
      Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon
  by the Japanese, the trading company official says. ""Japanese
  people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable
  deals."" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese
  companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. ""This is
  a healthy progression.""
      However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the
  board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.
      ""Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a
  large U.S. Or European corporation,"" one banker said. ""They will
  expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for
  Japanese business.""
      A foreign merchant banker also noted, ""There are not many
  mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big
  deals there have already been done.""
      But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of
  Japanese companies, the specialists said.
      Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in
  high-technology areas. ""Japanese companies had used technology
  and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate
  from that trend,"" one takeover specialist said.
      Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If
  these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.
      But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait
  until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading
  houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and
  foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as
  go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

"ENERGY SECRETARY SEES HIGHER OIL PRICES
  Energy Secretary Donald Hodel said he
  expects oil prices to rise significantly by the year 2000,
  probably to around 33 dlrs a barrel in current dollars.
      ""I do anticipate a significant increase (by 2000).
  Thirty-three dlrs a barrel is not unreasonable,"" Hodel told the
  Senate Energy Committee.
      Hodel said the loss of some domestic oil production through
  the shutdown of stripper (10 barrels a day or less) wells
  because of low prices was probably permanent. He said he was
  also concerned by the decline in domestic oil exploration.
      Hodel urged Congress to approve oil exploration in section
  1002 of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. He said
  geologic condtions in the area were favorable for the discovery
  of oil fields equal to those in nearby Prudhoe Bay.
      ""The area could contain potentially recoverable oil
  resources of more than 9.2 billion barrels, an amount nearly
  equal to the Prudhoe Bay oil field, which currently provides
  almost one-fifth of U.S. domestic production,"" Hodel said.
      He said production from the new section could begin about

"RUBBER TALKS CHAIRMAN CITES SLIGHT PROGRESS
  There has been slight progress towards
  reaching a rubber pact, the chairman of a United Nations
  conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreeement,
  INRA, Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said.
      ""There has been some slight progress but it is not the end
  of the road yet,"" he said.
      The conference, which began Monday, is seen as the last
  effort to adopt an accord to replace the current one which
  expires in October. Some 40 producing and consuming countries
  are taking part in the two-week meeting.
      Xuto said if the key outstanding issues are not resolved by
  tomorrow he would hold weekend meetings.
      At the beginning of the conference, the fourth such meeting
  in nearly two years, Xuto said it was imperative to settle
  those issues this week so that technical drafting work can be
  done next week.
      Conference sources said it is highly unlikely that
  producers will accept a pact that will provide for any possible
  downward adjustment of the floor price, as proposed by
  consumers under certain circumstances.
      The sources said this means that any possible adjustment
  would centre on the reference price, and the ""may buy"" (or ""may
  sell"") and ""must buy"" (or ""must sell"") levels without changing the
  ""lower indicative price"" (or floor price) of 150
  Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo in the present pact.
      The present five-day average of the indicator price is
  around 192 Malaysian/Singapore cents.
      Consumers are seeking an adjustment of the reference price,
  set in the current accord at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a
  kilo, and of the ""lower indicative price"" if the buffer stock,
  currently 360,000 tonnes, rises to 450,000 tonnes.
      Consumers want price reviews at 12-month intervals instead
  of the 18 at present, and the price revision mechanism to
  respond automatically to market trends.
      At present, if the market price has been above or below the
  reference price for six months, the reference price is revised
  by five pct or by an amount decided by the International
  Natural Rubber Organisation council.
      Consumers say that, in these circumstances, the adjustment
  be automatic at five pct or more.
      Producers have resisted reducing the role of the council in
  the price adjustment procedure and have expressed concern that
  changes proposed by consumers would weaken the present pact.

      ""We are having high level discussions on them (the issues)

"INDONESIA REJECTS WORLD BANK FARM REFORM PROPOSALS
  Indonesia rejected World Bank
  recommendations for sweeping reforms to its farm economy, as
  the country's foreign aid donors met to consider giving it 2.5
  billion dlrs in grants and soft loans.
      Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi, in written remarks
  distributed today as Indonesia's 14 foreign donor nations met
  at The Hague, said, ""The general argument presented by the Bank
  for this free trade, open economy view is weak.""
      The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the
  largest farm area in South-east Asia, and said agricultural
  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.
      The Bank report said Indonesia's rice production had peaked
  and the subsidies are a waste of money.
      Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides
  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were
  needed to support the fertilizer industry, including importers,
  exporters, producers and distributors, he said, as well as
  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.
      Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers
  should be free to choose their own crops, but he said the
  government would continue to maintain production targets for
  ""strategic commodities"" such as rice and sugar.
      The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia's
  drive to plant sugar, saying domestic sugar prices are double
  the world average because of inefficiencies, and the country
  would save money by importing the commodity.
      However, Affandi said volatile world sugar prices, the need
  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar
  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.
      He also said import barriers and trade monopolies in the
  agricultural sector were needed to help domestic industry
  develop and because of ""over-production and price intervention
  in the developed nations.""

"ALUMINIUM SCRAP RECOVERY AND USAGE TO RISE
  Aluminium scrap recovery and usage and
  output of secondary metal will continue to rise, said Shearson
  Lehman Brothers in a review of the secondary aluminium market
  which details cost and demand factors.
      Although primary smelting costs have declined generally in
  recent years, the still substantial energy cost savings offered
  by secondary smelters will continue to make re-melted material
  increasingly attractive.
      It takes around 15,000 kilowatt hours (kwh) of electricity
  to produce one tonne of primary aluminium compared with around
  550 kwh for one tonne of secondary metal, Shearson said.
      On the demand side, developments in automobiles and
  packaging bode well for secondary aluminium consumption.
      Automobile production, although expected to fall this year,
  is still on an upward trend and will continue to be so for the
  foreseeable future and, in addition, use of aluminium castings
  is gaining wider acceptance in the automobile industry,
  particularly in the U.S.
      In packaging, Shearson does not expect aluminium to
  dominate the beverage can market in any of the other major
  economies to the extent it does in the U.S., But says there is
  evidence recycling is on the increase in other countries.
      In addition to the cost savings involved, technology
  advances now enable alloys of higher purity to be produced by
  the secondary aluminium industry, Shearson said.
      There is not likely to be a problem of availability as the
  U.S. Has a huge scrap reservoir and this is also true of
  several European countries, albeit on a smaller scale.

"CHRYSLER &lt;C> AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 1.55 BILLION
  Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of
  American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,
  including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in
  American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.
      They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782
  mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.
      The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing
  Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's
  agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln
  dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not
  included valuing the transaction.
      Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed
  purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the
  transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in
  Chrysler's earnings.
      A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told
  Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it
  would have been had a deal been struck last year because the
  impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to
  assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards
  accumulated from its losses since 1980.
      ""There were very serious discussions last fall but we
  didn't pull it off,"" the source said in a reference to the
  assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges
  Besse.
      ""It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.
  And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done
  it before the end of last year.""
      In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the
  source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from
  lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called ""an overhang
  to the company.""
      Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that
  the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal
  in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln
  dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25
  mln dlrs in cash for ""transaction fees"" in connection with the

  AMC shareholders.
      ""The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,""
  analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.
       Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12
  billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.
       But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's
  liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC
  debt that is being carried at ""non-market"" rates.
      He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the
  previous Renault management on the acquisition because they
  were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an
  integral part.
      ""The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't

"US TROPICAL OIL LABELING PLAN SUFFERS DEFEAT
  A proposal to require imported
  tropical oils to be labeled as saturated fats suffered a narrow
  and possibly debilitating defeat in the U.S. Senate.
      The Senate Agriculture Committee rejected the proposal by a
  10-8 vote, virtually snuffing out U.S. soybean producers' hopes
  the plan would be adopted this year.
      A similar proposal has made no headway in the House.
      Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) offered the proposal as an
  amendment to a farm spending reduction package.
      ""I don't see this as a trade issue. I see it as giving
  American consumers the information they need,"" he said.
      Proponents of the measure, including the American Soybean
  Association, have claimed palm, palm kernel and coconut oils
  are high in saturated fat and can contribute to heart disease.
      The U.S. soybean industry believes labels indicating
  tropical oils are high in saturated fats would discourage
  consumption of the oils, imported primarily from Malaysia,
  Indonesia and the Philippines.
      But Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) read a letter from U.S.
  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who said the proposal
  ""blatantly discriminates"" against imports, would be impossible to
  defend under international trade law and would harm relations
  with the Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia.
      Yeutter's letter also said Americans derive most of their
  saturated fats from meat and dairy products and relatively
  little from tropical oils.
      The committee voted largely along party lines, with three
  Democrats joining seven Republicans to oppose the measure.

"SOYBEAN GROUPS MEET WITH LYNG TO DISCUSS LOAN
  A high-level meeting last week which
  included the Secretary of Agriculture and other senior  USDA
  officials, along with leaders of the major soybean lobbying
  groups, failed to reach any decision on what should be done
  about the soybean loan level, participants at the meeting told
  Reuters.
      ""We didn't feel a lot was accomplished last week, but we
  were delighted to meet with the Secretary, and he didn't close
  the door on anything,"" a member of the soybean delegation said.
      At issue is the current soybean loan and the fact that at
  the present level of 4.77 dlrs (without Gramm-Rudman
  reductions) it encourages foreign soybean production by making
  soybeans more profitable to grow than corn.
      But while recognizing that soybeans are priced too high in
  relation with corn, soybean groups have pledged their support
  to maintaining current price supports for soybean growers.
      Leaders of the American Soybean Association and the
  National Soybean Processors Association offered specific loan
  options to USDA Secretary Lyng in last week's meeting, but
  participants would not reveal what those options were.
      ""There were no surprises in our package,"" one participant
  said. Bandied about for several weeks has been the idea of
  offering producers soybean loans partially in cash and in
  certificates.
      The most prevailing scheme would be to pay a 4.77 loan with
  77 cts worth of soybean-specific certificates which would not
  have to be paid back and the remaining four dlrs in cash.
      This would have the effect of lowering the world price,
  maintaining domestic support levels and reducing the
  government's soybean inventory.
      A marketing loan for soybeans was not discussed at last
  week's meeting, participants said.
      One member of the soybean delegation said that the meeting
  was a ""listening session"" for USDA, and that the proposals will
  now be studied further by the Department.
      USDA officials, however, would not commit to any time
  frame. Participants in the meeting do not look for changes in
  the soybean loan to be announced in the near future.
      ""USDA is very sensitive about saying anything that could
  influence the market, so the Secretary was very non-committal,""
  a participant said.

"U.S. SENATE HITS EC OILS TAX, VOWS RETALIATION

      The non-binding Senate resolution, a sense of Senate
  sentiment, was approved on a 99 to 0 vote.
      ""The administration should communicate to the European

"SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID
  Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries
  for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the
  country's worst drought in 36 years, government officials said.
      Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid
  needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka's population in 13 districts.
      The letter said the government had to step in ""to avert
  serious economic hardship"" and because the Social Services
  Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision
  of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.
      The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six
  month period, at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop
  was harvested. Over 25,000 tonnes of wheat, rice, flour and
  other cereals were required, it said, along with supplies of
  sugar, lentils, dried or canned fish and milk.
      In some of the most seriously affected districts, the Maha
  (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been ""almost completely
  devastated,"" the letter said. Maha paddy output was now
  estimated at 70 mln bushels, 20 mln less than originally
  expected.
      There were two scenarios for the Yala crop, with a high
  forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate
  rainfall within the next three to four weeks.
      ""Should the present drought continue, however, production is
  estimated at around 20 mln bushels,"" the letter added.
      Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90
  and 110 mln bushels, or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last
  year's output was 124 mln bushels, down from 127 mln in 1985.
      The letter said villagers in most seriously affected
  districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because
  subsidiary crops had also failed.
      It said the government's current budget did not permit it
  to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.
  ""Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity
  prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue
  to exert pressure on the expenditure side.""
      The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per
  month for each family, as well as handling, transport and
  distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by
  the government would not be possible without seriously
  impairing development projects, or ""greatly fuelling inflation""
  in the economy, the letter said.
      The letter said the Food Department would be able to
  release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the
  immediate cereal requirements ""provided such stocks are replaced
  subsequently.""
      The Meteorological Department said the country was
  experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month
  dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when
  the monsoon rains fell in late May.
      The letter said some areas had been experiencing the
  drought since August, and in the rice growing district of
  Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June
  1986.

"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS
  Three geographically diverse droughts
  in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a
  reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino
  weather pattern, &lt;Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather
  forecasting service, said.
      Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane
  growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face
  serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive
  in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government
  officials and meteorologists said.
      Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said
  the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces
  have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.
      Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.
      Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan
  was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for
  over 20 years, the paper said.
      The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct
  compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many
  rivers, it added.
      This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing
  shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the
  Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many
  ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.
      Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across
  China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has
  recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average
  since early February.
      The New China News Agency said the average December
  temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher
  than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.
      Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka
  and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of
  Plantation Industries officials told Reuters
      In Australia, concern is growing about below-average
  rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the
  Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local
  Meteorological Bureau officials said.
      For many farmers and government officials the fear is that
  while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major
  threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the
  wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.
      Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought
  which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the
  occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as
  El Nino, they said.
      Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the
  Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single
  cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.
      Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for
  agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'
  was unique.
      The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and
  the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last
  major event in 1982/83, it said.
      El Nino, Spanish for ""Christ Child"" because it appears around
  Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds
  and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast
  of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with
  the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade
  winds, meteorologists said.
      The winds, strengthened by El Nino's ""pump"" effect, raise the
  sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.
      When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends
  a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it
  collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.
      One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the
  rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the
  Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.
      The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather
  said.
      China, where the affected areas have received between 40
  and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the
  May-September rains, it said.
      The May-September rains normally provide the
  drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.
      In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have
  received less than half the normal rainfall during the current
  wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing
  as the rainy season draws to an end.
      In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be
  at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually
  occur between April and June, although it is not possible at
  this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.

"BALLADUR MAINTAINS 1987 FRENCH INFLATION TARGET
  Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said he
  was maintaining his 2.5 pct inflation target for 1987 after the
  announcement earlier today of a 3.4 pct year-on-year rise in
  retail prices for February.
      He told a radio interviewer he saw no reason to revise his
  target for 1987 after the February monthly result of between
  0.1 to O.2 pct, following a 0.9 pct rise in January (three pct
  year on year) that forced the government to revise an earlier
  target of two pct to a current 2.5 pct.
      He said he was happy with ""a good result"" for February but
  stressed a need for continued ""vigilance"" against inflation.
      A Finance Ministry statement said the year-on-year
  differential between French and lower West German inflation
  rates, calculated on the last three months, had narrowed in
  February to two to 2.3 pct compared to 2.7 pct in January.
      If calculated on the last 12 months, the differential came
  to 3.9 pct, the statement said, adding ""The tendency is
  therefore one of a lessening of the inflation gap with our main

"BROADER U.S. EEP SOUGHT BY REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS
  Republican members of the House
  Agriculture Committee said they will propose amendments
  tomorrow to a pending trade bill increasing funding for the
  export enhancement program, EEP, and significantly expanding
  the scope of the program.
      At a press conference, Republican lawmakers said they would
  propose expanding EEP to include all countries ""willing to
  purchase additional commodities at reasonable prices.""
      In addition, the Congressmen said they would propose
  extending the life of EEP to five years from the current three
  years and increasing the EEP funding ceiling to 2.5 billion
  dlrs from 1.5 billion at present.
      The Agriculture committee tomorrow will begin drafting
  amendments to an omnibus trade bill now before the House.
      Responding to the Republican plan, Agriculture Secretary
  Richard Lyng and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said they
  favor a flexible, targeted use of EEP instead of an
  across-the-board program which they termed too costly.
      The Republican Congressmen also said they will offer an
  amendment to the trade bill instructing the U.S. Agriculture
  Department to value the bonus commodities used for EEP at the
  market value, rather than the cost of acquisition.
      But Lyng said USDA already plans to change to market value
  accounting rather than acquisition value, in order to avoid
  hitting a funding ceiling for eep of 1.5 billion dlrs.
      Lyng said under market value accounting only about 700 mln
  dlrs of EEP commodities have been used to date. Using
  acquisition value, USDA officials said the value is higher.

"U.S. ENERGY CHIEF SEES PROMISE IN OIL-TAX CHANGE
  Energy Secretary John Herrington
  said his proposed option to raise the oil depletion allowance
  to 27.5 pct was probably the most economically promising way to
  spur domestic production.
      The White House has said it would consider the option
  although it was generally opposed to any revisions in the new
  tax code.
      Herrington told a meeting of the Mid-Continent Oil and Gas
  Association that the higher depletion allowance on new oil and
  enhanced oil recovery would cost taxpayers about 200 mln dlrs a
  year.
      The option was one of many contained in a report on oil and
  the national security the Energy Department sent to the White
  House on Tuesday.
      Herrington said of the increased depletion allowance
  option: ""that is one that could significantly increase
  production at a very low cost to the American taxpayer.""
      He again rejected an oil import fee as far too costly to
  the overall U.S. economy.

"PAKISTAN UNVEILS NEW TRADE POLICY TO BOOST EXPORTS
  Pakistani government allowed freer
  cotton and rice export in a three-year new trade policy aimed
  at narrowing the country's yawning trade gap.
      Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a
  televised speech the government had also decided to allow
  duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry
  more competitive, and to link bulk tea imports to the export of
  Pakistani products.
     
      Cotton and rice are Pakistan's main exports, which have
  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early
  1970s.
      But Haq said now the private sector would also export
  cotton and rice along with the corporations, which meets a
  long-standing demand of the local traders.
      The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to
  bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries
  compete effectively in the world market, he said.
     
      Haq said the new policy, effective from the fiscal year
  1987/88 beginning on July 1, would be for three years but
  reviewed every year.
      It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing
  trade policies for a single fiscal year, and Haq said it would
  enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a
  longer period.
      He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided
  for the export of engineering goods to selected third world
  countries on soft credit terms.
     
      Pakistan's 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs, 18.2 per
  cent more than in the previous year, and imports at 5.23
  billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.
      He said the government policy was to rationalise and
  streamline import controls.
      ""It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports,
  specially on raw materials and intermediate goods, local
  industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs,"" he
  said. ""Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods
  produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise
  to smuggling and hampering of exports.""
     
      He said that to correct this situation, 136 items had freed
  from import restrictions.
      Previously, Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from
  remittances from its nationals working abroad, mainly in the
  Gulf. However, the remittances have begun to fall after the
  drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a
  balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.

"BANK OF ZAMBIA PAYS OUT FOREIGN CURRENCY ARREARS
  The Bank of Zambia has paid out foreign
  exchange arrears from three auctions conducted last year, a
  bank spokesman said.
      ""We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only
  four, worth eight mln dlrs,"" the spokesman said without
  specifying the amount paid out.
      The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms
  since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28.
      It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned
  to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank
  and the International Monetary Fund.
      President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the
  auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to
  approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to
  determine the kwacha's exchange rate.
      Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because
  of a shortage of foreign exchange.
      The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwacha
  per dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct.

"THAI BANKS WEIGH NEW INTEREST RATE CUT
  Officials of five Thai commercial banks
  are expected to meet tomorrow to seek agreement on cutting
  interest rates, banking sources said.
      They said they expect Thai banks to opt for a cut to spur
  domestic loan demand to help reduce persistent high liquidity
  on the money market.
      Many bankers have been urging an average half percentage
  point cut in deposit rates and a one point cut in lending
  rates, they said.
      Six major Thai major banks reduced minimum loan and
  overdraft rates by 0.50 to 0.75 percentage point on February 16
  but the move has not substantially increased loan demand, the
  sources said.
      Excess liquidity has been hitting bank profits since early
  last year despite five interest rate cuts in 1986. The current
  gross 7.25 pct interest rate for one-year fixed bank deposit
  and the 11.5 pct minimum loan rate are the lowest in a decade.
      Bankers said the Thai banking system is saddled with about
  40 to 50 billion baht of surplus funds which have created
  problems for many banks in managing their money effectively.
      Profits of many Thai banks fell sharply last year partly
  because of a mismatch of loan demand and bank deposit growth.
  The Bank of Thailand estimated overall lending by the Thai
  banking system grew 3.8 pct in 1986 against a 12 pct expansion
  in bank deposits.
      Reports of a possible new round of interest rate cuts have
  further buoyed the Thai stock market this week.
      The Securities Exchange of Thailand (SET) Index on Monday
  recorded its biggest daily advance in recent years, shooting up
  4.57 points to a new seven-year high of 223.02.
      Brokers and market analysts said Thai stocks will register
  more gains as long as liquidity remains in the money market.
      Thai and foreign bankers said the liquidity problem will
  grow if the Bank of Thailand does not extend permission for
  local banks to hold foreign exchange positions up to 40 pct of
  bank capital.
      If the regulation is not extended beyond its April 3 expiry
  date, many commercial banks will have to reduce foreign
  exchange holdings to a maximum 20 pct.
      Bankers said such that could add another five billion baht
  of surplus funds to the local money market.

"U.S. LAWMAKERS SUPPORT GULF ACTION
  American lawmakers rallied behind
  President Reagan for the U.S. strike against Iranian targets in

  debate over limits on his powers to make war.
      The Pentagon announced on Monday that U.S. warships

  Iranian oil rig in retaliation for an earlier Iranian attack on
  a Kuwaiti ship flying the American flag.
      Many Democrats, who control Congress, and Republicans

      But Democrats and liberal Republicans voiced new fears that
  the growing confrontation between Tehran and the United States

  with the 1973 War Powers Act, which could lead to a pullout of

"IRAQ REPORTS ATTACKS ON SUPERTANKER, OIL TARGETS
  Iraq said its warplanes had attacked a

  such raids until the Gulf war ends.
      The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations
  broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.
      It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad
  hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian
  year which ended on Saturday.
      A high command communique said warplanes hit the western
  jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and
  struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.
      The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August
  1985, was last raided in January.
      The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said
  columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.
      In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian
  tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier
  Gulf attack.
      But there has been no independent confirmation of today's

  Leading Australian onshore oil and gas

  rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the
  end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.
      It said it had also made significant progress in repaying
  debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds
  had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.
      Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid
  for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas
  company &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln
  dlrs.
      Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar
  denominated and significant currency purchases were made during
  the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held
  145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.
      Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,
  finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil
  exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to
  reserves -- less than depletion during the year.
      Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme
  to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for
  oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.
      Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and
  production volumes but with extra oil exploration and
  encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.
      But it called on the goverment to continue fostering
  domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.
      ""It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when
  exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when
  Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,""
  Massy-Green said.

      This lowered the company's debt-to-capitalization ratio

"INDONESIA TO IMPORT PALM OIL, FEARS MAY SHORTAGE
  Indonesia has issued licences to
  traders to import palm oil to avert a possible shortage of
  cooking oil during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan in May,
  Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh told Reuters.
      ""We have given permission for a small amount of imports to
  prevent a shortage during Ramadan,"" he said. He gave no figures
  for the amount of palm oil to be imported, but said it would
  come from Malaysia.
      Indonesia, the world's second largest palm oil producer,
  earlier denied it had granted palm oil import licences.
      Saleh was replying to a question from Reuters after traders
  in London said Indonesia had issued licences to import around
  135,000 tonnes of palm oil for delivery in April.
      Indonesia, with 168 mln people, is the world's largest
  Moslem country. During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day and
  have large meals after sunset.
      Indonesian crude palm oil exports in the first 11 months of
  1986 were 469,100 tonnes, according to central bank figures,
  against 652,000 tonnes in the whole of calendar 1985.
      Indonesia is expanding palm oil output, and Saleh did not
  explain why there might be a shortage during Ramadan.

"ECONOMIST URGES MORE TAXES TO LOWER N.Z. DOLLAR
  An income tax surcharge and capital
  gains tax could bring about an urgently needed depreciation of
  the N.Z. Dollar, independent economist Len Bayliss said.
      Bayliss, a former economist with the Reserve Bank and the
  Bank of New Zealand, said a major depreciation is needed to
  restore export competitiveness even if inflation is cut by
  current government policies.
      The taxes would help cut the budget deficit, which in turn
  would lower the value of the N.Z. Dollar, he said in a speech.
  He added that the deficit for the year ending March 1988 could
  be much higher than the government's 1.3 billion dlr forecast.
      Since the government was unlikely to cut expenditure as a
  percentage of gross domestic product, a major tax increase was
  probably unavoidable, Bayliss said.
      He would have preferred an increase in the 10 pct
  value-added goods and services tax, introduced in October 1986,
  but that would have had a short-term inflationary impact.
  Import tariffs should be lowered to minimise the inflationary
  impact of a currency depreciation.
      The government had failed to bring inflation down despite
  lower oil prices and an appreciation in the currency, he added.
      New Zealand's inflation rate was 16.9 pct in the year to
  end-September against 18.9 pct in the year to end June.
      The major deficiency in the government's anti-inflation
  policies was reliance on high interest and exchange rates and
  insufficient emphasis on reducing the budget deficit, Bayliss
  said. The government had also failed to reduce overseas debt
  and debt ratios and cut the balance of payments deficit.
      ""The widespread belief that (New Zealand's) problems are
  going to take much longer to solve than was originally thought
  is soundly based -- primarily because the government's
  macro-economic policies have been unsuccessful,"" Bayliss said.

"DOME PETE&lt;DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR
  Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
  from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of
  Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
  energy industry analysts said.
      Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
  part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
  mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
  pay down debt, analysts said.
      ""The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
  direction that might make it a saleable asset,"" said one analyst
  who asked not to be named.
      Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
  Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
  Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale ""at
  the right price.""
      Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
  billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
  it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
  Encor shares do not pay dividends.
      A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
  whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
      At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
  valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
  shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
      Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
  prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
  Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
      ""Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
  recent weeks with a runup in crude prices,"" Peters and Co Ltd
  oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
      ""The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
  sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
  they have been able to in recent years,"" he added.
      Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
  7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
  dlrs in early February.
      The company also recently set up its own operating
  management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
  Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
      Dome and Encor ""are actually going to get farther apart. So
  (the sale) does make a lot of sense,"" Mote said.
      However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
  Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
  proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
  Commerce Bank.
      ""I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
  they can,"" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
      Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
  block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
      ""Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
  something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
  sold out from under them,"" said analyst Gobert.
      Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
  liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
  Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
      Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
  possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
      Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
  debt and has a ""right of consent"" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
  holding.
      Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
  would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
  obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
  price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
  but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share ""are very
  attractive.""

"U.S. TREASURY PROPOSES S.AFRICAN URANIUM IMPORTS
  The U.S. Treasury proposed allowing 
  temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium
  oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending
  clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last
  fall.
      The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary
  imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it
  passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall
  -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.
      The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and
  oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their
  South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including
  the Soviet Union for processing.
      The Treasury also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods to be
  imported temporarily from South African state-controlled
  organizations for repair or servicing in the U.S.
      The South African sanctions law, enacted by the U.S. to
  protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by
  South Africa's white minority government, prohibited imports of
  uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel, coal and textiles at the
  end of 1986.

"U.K. BANKERS CONSIDER NEW ECGD FINANCING PLAN
  Representatives of major U.K. Based banks
  are meeting here today to consider a new plan for reducing the
  cost of financing British exports guaranteed by the Export
  Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), senior banking sources
  said.
      The plan is being developed in conjunction with the ECGD
  and the Bank of England.
      Neither the ECGD nor the Bank of England would comment on
  the plan. However, bankers said one of the main points under
  discussion is a plan to refinance the bulk of the ECGD's medium
  term credit portfolio in the international capital markets.
  
      The proposals involve introducing a set of interest margins
  on ECGD backed debt of 5/16 to 7/8 pct, depending on the size
  and maturity of the credit and the currency.
      The banks are likely to push for a higher margin. Bankers
  said that while these rates would reduce a bank's return they
  would still be more than those proposed about a year ago when
  the government attempted unsuccessfully to initiate another
  cost reduction plan.
      At the same time, the banks would be expected to allow the
  ECGD to realise additional savings by refinancing existing
  government backed credit in the capital markets.
  
      On credits that are refinanced an original lender would
  receive a residual margin of 7/16 pct for loans up to 10 mln
  stg and 3/16 pct on larger transactions.

  one mln tonnes, slightly up on 800,000 in 1984.
      SPK said Kampuchea planned to expand planting from 1.5 mln
  to 1.93 mln hectares and boost rice paddy output to 2.5 mln
  tonnes this calendar year.
      Two mln tonnes of paddy would produce some 1.3 mln tonnes
  of milled rice, above the 1.25 mln tonnes Kampuchea says is the
  minimum its 7.5 mln people need.

"LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987
  Liquefied natural gas imports from
  Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its
  economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.
      Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian
  state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in
  Algiers that such imports would be made this year.
      ""Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and
  the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay
  the import until 1988/1989,"" Daniel Tulis, a natural gas
  analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.
      Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former
  customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary
  of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials
  told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington
  Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.
      Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were
  feasible. ""On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have
  made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate
  profitably even in the current price environment,""  Frank
  Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.
     Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports
  on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend
  higher by the end of 1987.
      A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of
  Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm
  prices, Shearson's Tulis said.
     In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of
  supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.
      Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree,
  saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.
      Company sources also said that any negotiations with
  Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate
  volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market
  values.

"MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS
  &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its
  1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of
  depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> shares
  and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.
      Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's
  seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on
  its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some
  eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.
      He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal
  approaches about a takeover of the group but was not
  interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not
  elaborate.
      Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during
  the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc
  &lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year.
      The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the
  affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused
  on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the
  Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price
  during the bid.
      Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of
  corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance
  director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness
  affair.
      Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,
  resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider
  information. He currently faces criminal charges.
      Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been ""one of the
  most traumatic in our history,"" but that clients and staff had
  been supportive.
      ""I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have
  the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.""
      Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits
  of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from
  corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.
      Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the
  performance of the group so far in 1987 was ""within reasonable
  touch of the budget.""
      Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new
  chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as
  interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a
  new chief executive within a few months.
      He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of
  562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but
  declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going
  on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.
      Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on
  yesterday's 375p.

"DOLLAR EXPECTED TO FALL DESPITE INTERVENTION
  Central bank intervention in the
  foreign exchange markets succeeded in staunching the dollar's
  losses today, but senior dealers here believe the U.S. currency
  is headed for a further retreat.
      Although the intervention was widespread, dealers perceive
  that the six major industrial nations have differing levels of
  commitment to their recent accord to stabilize currencies.
      Moreover, hard economic realities hold greater sway over
  the currency market than central bank intervention and these
  argue for a further dollar decline, dealers said.
      ""The market can be bigger than the central banks. And
  economic fundamentals will always come to the fore,"" said a
  dealer at one major U.S. bank.
      As the dollar dropped to post-World War II lows against the
  yen today foreign exchange traders said the Bank of Japan,
  Federal Reserve Board and Bank of England intervened in the
  markets on behalf of the U.S. currency.
      Reports of the authorities' actions helped the dollar
  recover to about 149.45 yen in New York this afternoon from
  the post-war low of 148.20 yen in the Far East. But it still
  failed to regain Monday's U.S. closing level of 150.00/05 yen.
      Tokyo dealers said the Bank of Japan bought one to 1.5
  billion dlrs in Tokyo today and may also have purchased dollars
  yesterday in the U.S. via the Federal Reserve.
      Meanwhile, there were strong rumors in New York that the
  Fed also bought a modest amount of dollars around 148.50 yen
  today. Talk also circulated that the Bank of England purchased
  a small amount of dollars for yen.
      The Fed's last confirmed intervention was on January 28
  when it bought 50 mln dlrs in coordination with the Bank of
  Japan. But on March 11 the Fed also was rumored to have
  signalled displeasure with a dollar surge above 1.87 marks.
      The authorities' actions appeared to back up the February
  22 Paris pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain,
  France and Canada under which the nations agreed to cooperate
  to foster exchange rate stability around prevailing levels.
      But foreign exchange dealers were not overly impressed by
  the authorities' intervention which they said can only soften
  extreme moves in the market.
      For one thing, some dealers believed that the Fed's
  purchases were done on behalf of the Bank of Japan rather than
  for the U.S. central bank's own account, suggesting a rather  
  watered-down American commitment to the currency accord.
      The Bank of England's action also was thought to be
  completed on behalf of the Japanese central bank, reinforcing
  the market's view that Japan is the most resolute of the six
  nations in its support of the currency pact.
      ""No-one doubts the Bank of Japan is serious. But the other
  two central banks seem to be making more token gestures than
  anything else,"" said Chris Bourdain of BankAmerica Corp.
      ""I'm not convinced the intervention was concerted,"" said
  Earl Johnson of Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. 
  ""It's a yen problem more than anything else.""
      Some dealers said a rising wave of trade protectionist
  sentiment in the U.S. limits the extent to which the American
  authorities can endorse a stronger dollar against the yen.
      ""The dollar's break below the key 150 yen level ties the
  Treasury's hands behind its back. The U.S. cannot intervene on
  its own account because of the strength of protectionism here,""
  said Albert Soria of Swiss Bank Corp.
      Such comments reflect the view that the currency markets
  are becoming increasingly politicized. Despite official
  denials, some traders still feel the U.S. would countenance a
  lower dollar to help trim the nation's trade deficit.
      The majority of the 170 billion dlr merchandise trade
  deficit in 1986 was with Japan.
      Indeed U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker's comment on
  Sunday that the February currency pact had not established
  dollar targets was read by the market as a signal to sell the
  U.S. currency and kicked off the latest retreat.
      ""The dollar still has more room on the downside against the
  yen based on the frictions in trade and financial services. The
  currency market is becoming very political,"" said Natsuo Okada
  of Sumitomo Bank Ltd.
      Okada expects the dollar to trade between 148 and 150 yen
  this week but sees the chance of a drop to 140 yen by the end
  of April or early May.
      Even if West Germany and Japan succeed in stimulating their
  economies, it may not be enough to solve structural economic
  imbalances in the near future, dealers said.
      ""Even if Japan and West Germany do expand this year, it
  won't be enough to help the trade situation much,"" said
  Bourdain of BankAmerica, who also expects the dollar to drop to
  148 yen in the next couple of days.

  Iran said several people were injured in

      It quoted President Ali Khamenei as saying, ""We will
  definitely retaliate and will not leave this American move

"MIYAZAWA EXPECTS DOLLAR REBOUND SOON - SPOKESMAN

"AUSTRALIAN TERMS OF TRADE WORSEN IN LAST QUARTER
  Australia's terms of trade fell by a
  further 3.5 pct in the fourth quarter of 1986 after declining
  0.8 pct in the third quarter and 2.7 pct a year earlier, the
  Statistics Bureau said.
      It said the seasonally adjusted current account deficit of
  3.22 billion dlrs in the quarter would have dropped to 912 mln
  if not for the terms of trade decline.
      The fourth quarter decline followed a 1.1 pct fall in
  export prices and a 2.4 pct rise in import prices, it said.
      The Bureau noted Australia's terms of trade had fallen by
  19.9 pct since the fourth quarter of 1983.

"BANK OF FRANCE LAUNCHES MONEY MARKET TENDER
  The Bank of France said it set a money
  market intervention tender today to inject funds to the market
  against first category paper.
      Money market sources said the surprise announcement might
  herald a quarter percentage point cut in the central bank
  intervention rate from the 7-3/4 pct level set March 10, but
  they added such a cut was relatively unlikely.
      The intervention rate was cut from eight pct on March 10
  after being raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 to head off
  speculative pressure against the franc.
      Dealers said market fundamentals could justify a further
  easing, but a combination of technical factors and renewed
  currency uncertainties surrounding the dollar had put
  short-term upside pressure on interest rates in recent
  sessions.
      Call money rose yesterday to 7-7/8 eight pct from 7-3/4 7/8
  pct. Today it was first indicated at 8-1/8 1/4 before easing on
  news of the tender to 7-13/16 7/8 pct.
      Technical factors making for a slight shortage of liquidity
  in the market included the settlement yesterday of the latest
  monthly treasury tap stock tender, on March 5, market sources
  said.

"ATT &lt;T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS
  American Telephone and Telegraph Co's
  proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is
  unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it
  should help the company's profits, analysts said.
      ""Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large
  volume users, but status quo for residential users,"" said
  PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.
      But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has
  constrained the company's profits in the long distance
  business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.
      ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance
  business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated
  rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut
  last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.
      Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal
  Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount
  of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to
  its competitors to oppose it filings.
      MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> made a similar filing
  yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition
  in the telephone business.
      Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in
  the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins
  previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said
  they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in
  the industry, simply because of the competition the phone
  industry giant faces.
      ""You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,""
  said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. ""But you wouldn't
  see a rise."" Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to
  selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. ""It
  will give ATT a lot more flexibility,"" he said.
      ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of
  companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC
  hearings.
      It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the
  long distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United
  Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>.
      ""We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a
  reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it,"" a U.S.
  Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed
  to greater competition.
      It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,
  and in the process they may be altered by the various
  constituencies affected by the move.
      ""There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much
  bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it
  won't happen that fast,"" said analyst Victor Krueger of the
  Gartner Group.

"UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS EC SUGAR TENDER RESULT-TRADE
  Considerable uncertainty surrounds the
  outcome of today's EC white sugar tender, traders here said,
  noting it remains overshadowed by European operator threats to
  move over 800,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.
      They said that due to the dispute between the Commission
  and producers over the issue, it is not clear whether the
  Commission will authorise any exports at all or grant licences
  on a large tonnage.
      The subsidy is seen being set above 45.00 Ecus per 100
  kilos, although traders are reluctant to predict a precise
  level after prices fell yesterday.
      Earlier, traders in Paris said they expected the Commission
  to award licences for around 50,000 tonnes of white sugar with
  a maximum export rebate of 45.75 to 46.0 Ecus.

"SRI LANKA TO UPROOT OR BUD DISEASED RUBBER TREES
  Sri Lanka will uproot rubber trees that
  are more than two years old and affected by the leaf disease
  corynespora, the head of the government's Rubber Research
  Institute told Reuters.
      Rodney De Mel said affected trees less than two years old
  would undergo base-budding -- attaching a clone as close as
  possible to the trunk's base and cutting off the top of the
  tree once the bud has taken. Uprooted or base-budded trees
  mature later, causing an output loss estimated at 350 kilos per
  hectare from the sixth year when they begin producing.
      About 7,000 acres are planted with the high yielding RIC
  103 variety, the clone afflicted by corynespora.
      Only about 2,000 acres are affected by the disease, which
  causes leaves to fall off, De Mel said.
      Sri Lanka has 508,000 acres planted with rubber trees.
      De Mel said the disease was detected in nurseries as early
  as in middle 1985, but it was only in August-September 1986
  that it became widespread.
      The Institute is conducting a survey to determine how many
  trees will be uprooted or base-budded. Healthy trees will be
  sprayed and remain under observation.
      T.P. Lilaratne, head of the government's Rubber Controller
  Department, which monitors the industry, told Reuters
  replanting and base-budding would have to be undertaken before
  late May when the monsoon rains begin.
      De Mel said clones in the nurseries which are susceptible
  to corynespora, identified as RIC 103, RIC 52, RIC 104, RIC
  106, RIC 107 and RIC 118, will be uprooted and burned.
      The same procedures will be undertaken for the foreign
  clones indentified as NAB 12, RRIM 725, FX25, PPN 2444, PPN
  2447, KRS 21 and PPN 2058.
      Lilaratne said the susceptible clones would be replaced by
  PB 86, RRIM 600, RRIC 110, RRIC 121, RIC 100 and RIC 102.
      These six varieties would also be used to replace trees
  uprooted or base-budded, De Mel said.
      Lilaratne said planters would receive 10,000 rupees per
  hectare for replanting and plants would be free of charge.
      ""But no compensation is contemplated at the moment,"" he
  added.
      De Mel said a drought in Sri Lanka has helped control the
  spread of the disease.
      ""The drought has not stopped the disease, but probably
  helped in some way because trees have not been affected in
  areas that are dry,"" he said.
      Brokers said the disease had not affected prices because it
  has not caused a drop in production.
      Prices for the best latex crepe at the Colombo auction last
  week firmed to 20.19 rupees per kilo from 20.05 rupees at the
  previous sale.

"PHILIPPINE SUGAR CROP SET AT 1.6 MLN TONNES
  Philippine sugar production in the
  1987/88 crop year ending August has been set at 1.6 mln tonnes,
  up from a provisional 1.3 mln tonnes this year, Sugar
  Regulatory Administration (SRA) chairman Arsenio Yulo said.
      Yulo told Reuters a survey during the current milling
  season, which ends next month, showed the 1986/87 estimate
  would almost certainly be met.
      He said at least 1.2 mln tonnes of the 1987/88 crop would
  be earmarked for domestic consumption.
      Yulo said about 130,000 tonnes would be set aside for the
  U.S. Sugar quota, 150,000 tonnes for strategic reserves and
  50,000 tonnes would be sold on the world market.
      He said if the government approved a long-standing SRA
  recommendation to manufacture ethanol, the project would take
  up another 150,000 tonnes, slightly raising the target.
      ""The government, for its own reasons, has been delaying
  approval of the project, but we expect it to come through by
  July,"" Yulo said.
      Ethanol could make up five pct of gasoline, cutting the oil
  import bill by about 300 mln pesos.
      Yulo said three major Philippine distilleries were ready to
  start manufacturing ethanol if the project was approved.
      The ethanol project would result in employment for about
  100,000 people, sharply reducing those thrown out of work by
  depressed world sugar prices and a moribund domestic industry.
      Production quotas, set for the first time in 1987/88, had
  been submitted to President Corazon Aquino.
      ""I think the President would rather wait till the new
  Congress convenes after the May elections,"" he said. ""But there
  is really no need for such quotas. We are right now producing
  just slightly over our own consumption level.""
      ""The producers have never enjoyed such high prices,"" Yulo
  said, adding sugar was currently selling locally for 320 pesos
  per picul, up from 190 pesos last August.
      Yulo said prices were driven up because of speculation
  following the SRA's bid to control production.
      ""We are no longer concerned so much with the world market,""
  he said, adding producers in the Negros region had learned from
  their mistakes and diversified into corn and prawn farming and
  cloth production.
      He said diversification into products other than ethanol
  was also possible within the sugar industry.
      ""The Brazilians long ago learnt their lessons,"" Yulo said.
  ""They have 300 sugar mills, compared with our 41, but they
  relocated many of them and diversified production. We want to
  call this a 'sugarcane industry' instead of the sugar industry.""
      He said sugarcane could be fed to pigs and livestock, used
  for thatching roofs, or used in room panelling.
      ""When you cut sugarcane you don't even have to produce
  sugar,"" he said.
      Yulo said the Philippines was lobbying for a renewal of the
  International Sugar Agreement, which expired in 1984.
      ""As a major sugar producer we are urging them to write a new
  agreement which would revive world prices,"" Yulo said.
      ""If there is no agreement world prices will always be
  depressed, particularly because the European Community is
  subsidising its producers and dumping sugar on the markets.""
      He said current world prices, holding steady at about 7.60
  cents per pound, were uneconomical for the Philippines, where
  production costs ranged from 12 to 14 cents a pound.
      ""If the price holds steady for a while at 7.60 cents I
  expect the level to rise to about 11 cents a pound by the end
  of this year,"" he said.
      Yulo said economists forecast a bullish sugar market by
  1990, with world consumption outstripping production.
      He said sugar markets were holding up despite encroachments
  from artificial sweeteners and high-fructose corn syrup.
      ""But we are not happy with the Reagan Administration,"" he
  said. ""Since 1935 we have been regular suppliers of sugar to the
  U.S. In 1982, when they restored the quota system, they cut
  ours in half without any justification.""
      Manila was keenly watching Washington's moves to cut
  domestic support prices to 12 cents a pound from 18 cents.
      The U.S. Agriculture Department last December slashed its
  12 month 1987 sugar import quota from the Philippines to
  143,780 short tons from 231,660 short tons in 1986.
      Yulo said despite next year's increased production target,
  some Philippine mills were expected to shut down.
      ""At least four of the 41 mills were not working during the
  1986/87 season,"" he said. ""We expect two or three more to follow
  suit during the next season.""

"TEXACO &lt;TX> RESERVES DOWN DESPITE LOWER OUTPUT
  Texaco Inc's oil and gas reserves
  declined in 1986 despite reduced production and upward
  revisions in the company's previous reserve estimates, its
  annual report said.
      The statement of the report's auditor was qualified -- as
  was the previous one -- because of the unkonwn final impact of
  the judgement won by Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL> against Texaco on
  charges Texaco interfered with Pannzoil's contract to acquire
  Getty Oil Co.
      The auditor's point out, as Texaco has in the past, the
  company's loss of any of several pending court decisions in
  this case could cause it ""to face prospects such as having to
  seek protection of its assets and business pursuant to the
  bankruptcy and reorganization provisions of Chapter 11"" of the
  federal bankruptcy code.
      Commenting on a Texas Court of Appeals ruling which reduced
  Pennzoil's judgement by two billion dlrs, to 9.1 billion dlrs,
  Texaco said it will file a motion for a rehearing by the
  appeals court no later than March 30.
      Texaco said the proven crude oil reserves of the company
  and its consolidated subsidiaries totaled 2.54 billion barrels
  at the end of 1986, down from 2.69 billion a year earlier.
      However, inclusion of Texaco's equity in the Eastern
  Hemisphere reserves of a nonsubsidiary company limited the
  decline to 2.91 billion barrels from 3.00 billion at the end of
  1985.
      Worldwide production by the consolidated subsidiaries
  declined to 341 mln barrels last year from 362 mln in 1985 and
  upward revisions in previous reserve estimates rose to 143 mln
  barrels from 117 mln, respectively.
      Texaco said the largest drop in reserves came in the United
  States -- where the total dropped to 1.46 billion barrels from
  1.55 billion.
      The company said U.S. liquids production averaged 660,000
  barrels per day last year, down from 714,000 in 1985, with
  about 44 pct of the decline -- some 24,000 barrels per day --
  representing high-cost production shut-in or curtailed in
  response to the decline in crude oil prices during 1986.
      Texaco said its natural gas reserves totaled 8.16 trillion
  cubic feet at year end, down from 8.87 trillion cubic feet at
  the end of 1985.

"GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS
  The ruling GATT Council deferred a
  decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a
  European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese
  agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.
      David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties
  would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of
  resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.
      The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect
  the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips,
  officially known as semiconductors.
      The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by
  allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum
  prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.
      The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave
  U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.

"PAPANDREOU SAYS GREEKS READY FOR AGGRESSORS
  Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou
  said today that the Greek armed froces were ready to tackle any
  aggressors following the sailing of a Turkish research vessel
  and warships towards disputed waters in the Aegean Sea.
      Papandreou told an emergency cabinet meeting in Athens ""the
  military readiness of our country is able now to give a very
  hard lesson if our neighbours (Turkey) were to carry out
  military actions.""
      He said the activities of the research vessel could be
  aimed at partitioning the Aegean.
      ""The air force, navy and army are in a state of alert,""
  General Guven Ergenc, Secretary General of the Turkish General
  Staff, told a news conference.
      He said the Turkish research ship Sismik 1, escorted by an
  unspecified number of warships, would sail into disputed waters
  in the Aegean Sea tomorrow morning.
      Ergenc told Reuters later that all leave had been cancelled
  for members of the armed forces in the Aegean coast area.
      The Turkish government said yesterday it had licensed the
  state-owned Turkish Petroleum Corp to explore for oil in
  international waters around three Greek islands off Turkey.
       Greece and Turkey have long-standing disputes over areas
  of the Aegean and the presence of Turkish troops in Cyprus.
      The latest row erupted when the Greek government said last
  month that it was taking control of a Canadian-led consortium
  which was already producing oil off the Greek island of Thassos
  and would drill in the same area after the takeover.
      Ergenc told the news conference the alert followed a
  government decision that Turkey should protect its interests
  ""because of measures Greece has been taking in the Aegean in
  violation of international agreements.""
      Asked how Turkey would react if Greece attacked any of the
  vessels, he said ""If there is an attack, it is clear what has to
  be done. An attack on a warship is a cause for war."" But he
  added ""We are not in a state of war. The measures taken by the
  military are directed towards protecting our rights.""
      Greece said yesterday it would defend its national rights
  in the Aegean and urged Turkey to accept reference of the
  dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
      Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Yalim Eralp told
  reporters today this was unacceptable because of preconditions
  Athens had attached.
      In Athens, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou said that if the
  Turkish vessel Sismik 1 began research operations ""we will
  hinder it, of course not with words, as it cannot be stopped
  with words.""
      Greek newspapers said the armed forces were on alert and
  navy ships had gone to the Aegean. But government spokesman
  Yannis Roubatis did not confirm the move, saying only ""The Greek
  fleet is not at its naval base.""
      Papandreou said that a map issued in Turkey showed 95 pct
  of the areas proposed for research were on the Greek
  continental shelf.
      Papandreou told the U.S. And NATO that if they had a part
  in orchestrating the present crisis in order to force Greece to
  negotiate with Turkey, the Greek government would not accept
  it.
      Papandreou has maintained in the past that he will not
  negotiate with Ankara until Turkey recognises Greek rights in
  the Aegean and withdraws its troops from Cyprus.
      He said that in the case of war with Turkey it would not be
  possible for Greece to discuss the future of American military
  bases here. Asked by reporters if he would close the U.S. Bases
  in Greece in the event of war, Papandreou replied ""Obviously,
  and perhaps even before the war.""

"ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE
  The Zambian government has no immediate
  plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of
  maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an
  official of the ruling party said.
      Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for
  refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in
  which at least 15 people died.
      That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later
  revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund
  (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.
      However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67
  dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price
  increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies,
  a practice discouraged by the IMF.
      ""There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of
  meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the
  demands of the IMF and those of the people,"" a Ministry of
  Agriculture economist said.

"MAJOR U.S. OIL PIPELINE SHUT DOWN BY FLOODS
  Flooding in the Red River on the
  Texas/Oklahoma border has shut down the Basin Pipeline, a
  24-inch pipeline that transports as much as 300,000 barrels per
  day of sweet and sour crudes from Texas to Cushing, Okla, a
  Texaco Pipeline Co spokesman confirmed.
      ""The water is rushing by so fast that we can't get any
  divers down to assess the damage but there is some possibility
  that the pipeline could be up by the end of the week,"" a company
  source said.
      The pipeline transmits roughly two-thirds sour crude and
  one-third sweet crude oil from the Midland, Texas region.
      Texaco sources said that if the pipeline service is
  restored by Friday there would be little problem in restoring
  oil which has been lost to the flood.
      ""But if the pipeline is down more than 10 days it will be
  difficult to make up without prorationing and we would not like
  to proration this pipeline, if we don't have to.""
      The Basin Pipeline is jointly owned by Atlantic Richfield
  Corp &lt;ARC>, Shell Oil Co, a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group &lt;RD> and Texaco Inc &lt;TX>, which is the pipeline's
  operator.
       Peter Beutel, analyst at Elders Futures Inc, said crude
  oil futures contracts on New York Mercantile Exchange rose to
  new highs this afternoon following news of the pipeline break.
      July crude futures of West Texas Intermediate traded up to
  19.60 dlrs a barrel, a rise of more than 20 cts.
      Cash market prices also firmed on the news with sellers of
  WTI raising offers to 19.60 dlrs a barrel.
      Sour crudes, which would be most affected by the pipeline
  shutdown, however, were slow to react to the news with West
  Texas Sour and Alaska North Slope holding 50 cts to one dlr a
  barrel below WTI, respectively.
      Dan Stevens, manager of public and government affairs at
  Texaco, said the company hopes to fix the pipeline in five days
  but that will depend on when the water level of the Red River
  recedes. There is already evidence that the water level is
  dropping and it appears the rain has stopped in the area
  affecting the pipeline, Stevens said.
      He said the segment of the pipeline that was damaged was
  underground and at a distance from the Red River that flooded.
  The pipeline runs over the Red River and under the subsoil
  nearby, according to Stevens. He said some of this subsoil was
  apparently washed away.
     
      The potential for environmental damage is being downplayed
  at this time despite the volume of oil that runs through this
  line.
      Texaco's Stevens said that aerial surveillance has not
  found any crude on the water in the river or in Lake Texoma,
  which is nearby.

"DIVISION SEEN ON HOW TO HELP U.S. OIL INDUSTRY
  The U.S. Congress and the oil industry
  are deeply divided on ways the government should assist the
  industry, hurt by the sharp fall in oil prices, and the
  subsequent growth in oil imports, industry analysts said.
      ""The industry is deeply divided between those who support an
  oil tariff and those who believe tax incentives are better,""
  said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research
  Associates, which recently completed a survey of the U.S.
  Congress on energy issues.
      Yergin said he saw mounting support within Congress for tax
  incentives rather than an oil tariff or import fee.
      Today U.S. Energy Secretary John Herington said he will
  propose tax incentives to increase edomestic oil and natural
  gas exploration and production to the Reagan Administration for
  consideration. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
  proposal would be reviewed.
      Herrington said, ""I would like to shoot for one mln barrels
  a day (addition) to U.S. production."" U.S. oil output was off to
  8.4 mln bpd in the week of March 13, down six pct from last
  year, the American Petroleum Institute said.
      Oil industry analysts have forecast oil prices to average
  about 18 dlrs a barrel for the year and many believe that a
  move above that level will be unlikey for the near term.
      Paul Mlotok, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc said that
  ""even with the rise in prices for the last week or two we've
  only altered our average price scenerio to about 17.50 dlrs for
  the year.""
      Analysts said that at that price renewed drilling and
  exploration to reverse the decline in U.S. crude oil output
  will not take place as the companies are waiting for stable
  prices over 20 dlrs to renew exploration.
      John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry
  Research Foundation Inc in New york in recent testimony to
  Congress said ""The continuing decline in U.S. oil production is
  virtually inevitable under any realistic price scenario. But
  the future rate of decline is very much a function of world oil
  prices and U.S. government policy.""
      Lichtbalu said that tax breaks could be used to raise oil
  production but would only work over time.
      ""Lowering the producing industry's tax burden would probably
  be a slower stimulant (to output) than a price increase but
  would not raise energy costs."" Lichtblau said.
      But the small independent oil companies who do much of the
  drilling in the U.S. are looking for the more immediate relief
  which could be brought on by an oil import fee.
      Ronald Tappmeyer, president of the International
  Association of Drilling Contractors, said, ""The members of our
  trade asssociation are convinced that only a variable oil
  import fee that sets a minimum price trigger can protect our
  nation."" The association represents some 1,300 drilling and oil
  service companies.
      The CERA survey of Congress shows that the oil import fee
  will face a stiff uphill battle.
      Yergin said that the poll which was conducted in January by
  a former Congressman, Orval Hansen, showed support for the oil
  import fee from 22 pct of the Congressmen surveyed largely as a
  means of protecting the domestic petroleum industry.
       At the same time 48 pct of the Congressmen surveyed
  opposed the fee with the respondents saying the tariff would
  hurt consumers and some regional interests.
      But 80 pct of the sample said support for a fee could grow
  if production continued to fall and imports to rise.
      Yergin said that imports above 50 pct of U.S. requirements
  ""is a critical, symbolic level. If they (imports) move above
  that level, a fee may not be legislated but there will
  certainly be pressure for some form of action.""
       But Lichtblau, in a telephone interview, said, ""a 50 pct
  rate of import dependency is not likely to happen before 1990.
      In 1986 U.S. oil imports rose to 33 pct of u.s. energy
  requirements and shopuld be about 34 pct in 1987, he added.

      The company said if the conditions occur the warrants would
  be exercisable at a price equal to 75 pct of its common stock's
  market price at the time, not to exceed 1.50 dlrs per share.
      Computer Terminal also said it sold the technolgy rights to
  its Dot Matrix impact technology, including any future
  improvements, to &lt;Woodco Inc> of Houston, Tex. for 200,000
  dlrs. But, it said it would continue to be the exclusive

"AUSTRALIAN MINISTER SEES TARGETED OIL TAX STRATEGY
  Australia's crude
  oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a
  targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources
  and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.
      He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association
  (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a
  package that would recognise the government's economic
  priorities while also meeting some of the industry's concerns.
      Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review
  of oil taxation.
      Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted
  approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results
  in recent years.
      These include the reduction in the top marginal crude
  excise rate on 'old' Bass Strait oil found before September
  1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore
  oil announced last September, he said.
      The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the
  elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost
  incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices
  and Australia's relatively low exploration levels.
      ""While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to
  an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour
  these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes,
  which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still
  leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are
  going to do in major areas,"" Evans said.
      He said the government did not intend to change its
  resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before
  parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all
  exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.
      As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to
  highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a
  certain rate of return has been achieved for individual
  projects.
      APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because
  exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.
      Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more
  than anything on the government's desire to ensure the
  certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major
  investments have already been planned on the existing ground
  rules.

"U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION
  All major grain producing countries
  must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the
  recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S.
  wheat organizations said.
      The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point
  for discussions, ""but we do not want the Australians to feel
  they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions"" on world
  grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat
  Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said
  in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.
  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.
      Future discussions on international wheat trade should
  include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of
  government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public
  disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are
  involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.
  have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the
  two organizations said 
      While the Australian proposals are welcome the two
  organizations said they are not in total agreement with their
  assessments.
      Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target
  prices and ""quarantine"" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to
  place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.
  farmers, they said.
        Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted
  from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.
  acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.
      ""We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and
  subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking
  grain and changing programs which protect our growers,"" Jim
  Miller, president of NAWG said.
      ""We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the
  world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and
  restore profitability to agriculture,"" Miller said.

"ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN
  President Leon Febres Cordero said
  Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
  payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have
  to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
      Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was
  forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the
  slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to
  private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16
  billion dlr foreign debt.
      ""All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour,"" the
  president said during a visit to the quake zone. ""A government
  as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain.""
      Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
  would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
  to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
      He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17
  dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs
  a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.
      Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a
  price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the
  earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.
      Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would
  be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and
  salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet,
  would be reduced.
      He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic
  consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of
  gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares
  would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited.

"OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987
  The 24 nations of the Organisation for
  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by
  sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic
  growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into
  deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.
      The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD
  economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a
  2.8 pct growth forecast in December.
      It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the
  smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest
  hit by currency appreciation this year.
      The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth
  rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in
  December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.
      It said it expected the OECD to post a current account
  deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in
  large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.
      It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to
  fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in
  1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.
      It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr
  payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.
      The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50
  dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18
  dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes
  increasingly ragged.
      It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in
  foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its
  trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last
  year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at
  1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate
  is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an
  average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.
      ""This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper
  angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball
  rather than a three-point landing,"" the EIU said.
      ""Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the
  February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and
  Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to
  more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter
  U.S. Fsical policy,"" it said.
      It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the
  willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government
  assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.
      ""Thus far they have been willing,"" the EIC said, adding
  that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar
  would collapse.
      To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates
  would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt
  crisis, it said.
      On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look
  ""increasingly sick.""
      Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen
  slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to
  4.2 pct in 1988, it said.
      The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest
  single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a
  sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in
  December, the EIU said.
      On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West
  Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while
  Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S.
  Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more
  competitively-priced dollar.
      It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and
  oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.

"IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED
  Efforts by governments to control wheat
  surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial
  success, the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its
  latest monthly report.
      Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing
  both price and areas, as employed in the United States, the IWC
  says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat
  exporters - Argentina, Australia, Canada, the EC and the U.S.
      In some countries, for example Australia and Argentina,
  which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export
  income, there may be problems in reducing production.
      A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to
  unemployment, with job prospects outside agriculture limited.
  Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then
  lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.
      The IWC outlines three courses of action open to
  governments in wheat exporting countries.
      They could continue to support prices in the hope that when
  the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and
  surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.
      Alternatively, support could be limited to wheat which
  could be easily sold, without needing to be stored for a long
  period.
      This option may prove to be the most politically
  unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning
  wheat production, the report said.
      The third option would be for governments to distinguish
  between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture,
  possibly varying support prices according to farm size or
  overall production.
      The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting
  countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the
  producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.
      These changes did not always result in lower export
  subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more
  than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.
      For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention
  price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European
  currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms, the currency in which
  most export transactions are denominated, the intervention
  price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of
  supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers
  and some governments are now searching for ways to cut
  expenditure, the report says.
      The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five
  major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey
  from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to
  increased production in China and India.
      The period saw an upward trend in yields, although this was
  countered in the Argentina, the U.S. And Australia by lower
  acreages.
      In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per
  cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to
  other enterprises, particularly livestock while lower U.S.
  Acreages are attributed to official incentives.

"TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT &lt;PIE>
  Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for
  USAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,
  which was being courted by USAir.
      Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4
  billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir
  takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to
  accepting the bid.
      Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and
  said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its
  takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.
      Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was
  off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread
  it would be taken over.
      Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt
  to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a
  suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.
     ""The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or
  Piedmont and USAir announce a deal,"" speculated one arbitrager.
      Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current
  price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will
  succeed.
      Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk
  Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the
  company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of
  Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.
      Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of
  Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is
  destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the
  least likely to be bought.
      Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in
  the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a
  three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.
      But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's
  offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with
  contingencies.
      Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two
  airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.
      ""You can't discount him,"" said one arbitrager.
      Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is
  serious by following through with his threats or making a new
  offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go
  directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower
  price if USAir rejected his offer.
      ""It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,"" said
  one arbitrager.
      Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by
  about six dlrs per share.
      Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline
  combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but
  others believe it could be cleared if the companies are
  acquired separately.
      ""TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to
  work,"" said one analyst.
      Analysts said such a merger would be costly and
  complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn
  succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.
      In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage
  scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,
  analysts said.
      Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they
  said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'
  costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a
  necessary ingredient for a merger to work.
      However, other analysts speculated the managements of
  Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new
  company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way
  for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged
  into TWA.

"TEXAS COMMERCE &lt;TCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987
  Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that
  relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with
  Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase
  from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs.
      Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with
  Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected
  earnings to increase.
      ""We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement
  over last because we are stronger,"" Love said, referring to
  Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.
  The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will
  lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15
  basis points, Love said.
      The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition
  by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved
  interstate banking effective January 1.
      Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas'
  struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report
  profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which
  earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc &lt;ALBN> lost 17.6
  mln dlrs, MCorp &lt;M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5
  mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation &lt;FBT>, which is actively
  seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln
  dlrs.
      Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its
  energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's
  nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.
      ""I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,"" he
  said. ""The fact that the real estate market is still moving
  away suggests there could be some continuing growth of
  nonperforming loans.""
      In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses
  related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy
  loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the
  bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43
  pct.
      More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans,
  which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln
  dlrs the year before, were in real estate.
      Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for
  Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the
  third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office
  buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about
  30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four
  years, he said.
      ""I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil
  at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a
  barrel,"" he said.
      Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate
  subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its
  holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to
  build up its consumer banking business, Love said. ""We are
  resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,""
  he said.
      In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in
  Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,
  and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas
  Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the
  Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member
  banks, he said.
      One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced
  in December, InterFirst Corp &lt;IFC> and RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT>,
  both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued
  at 570 mln dlrs.
      The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and
  InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas
  banking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion
  plans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. ""We think
  we can try to get a little part of their roost,"" he said.
      The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an
  edge in developing new consumer products, he said.
      ""We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than
  one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us
  how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,"" he
  said, referring to expansion of such existing products as
  credit cards and investment banking.

"ALLEGIS &lt;AEG> TO SELL CANADIAN HOTELS
  Allegis Corp said it has created a

  public.
      It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350
  mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of
  September.
      The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin
  Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis
  sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis
  reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that
  partnership.
     
      An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in
  planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent
  corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan
  and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston
  Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.
      The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which
  of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.
      Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in
  Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in
  Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60
  pct of the Westin in Edmonton.
      Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement
  the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert
  unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.
      As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,
  the money will be used for general corporate needs, the
  spokesman said.
      Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead

"NORSTAR &lt;NOR>, FLEET &lt;FLT> OUTLINE MERGER
  Fleet Financial Group said
  that its board and the board of Norstar Bancorp have agreed to
  merge the two bank holding companies in a transaction which
  would create a 23 billion dlr asset bank holding company.
      Under terms of the transaction, each Norstar shareholder
  will receive 1.2 shares of Fleet common stock based on the
  number of Fleet shares after giving effect to a previously
  announced April one Fleet stock split.
       The two-for-one stock split will increase Fleet's
  currently 25.7 mln outstanding shares to 51.5 shares. There are
  about 34.9 mln Norstar shares outstanding.
      Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one
  1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's
  interstate banking law takes effect.
      For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island
  based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln
  dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y.
  holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and
  assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.
       Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the
  transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar
  earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that
  cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline
  for either company's stock holders, the company said.
      For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash
  dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual
  distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68
  dlrs a share.
      In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other
  an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued
  shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the
  fully diluted shares outstanding.
      The transaction is subject to both regulatory and
  shareholder approval.
      The companies said that after the proposed merger, the
  combined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the
  country.

"SAUDI TO REMAIN AS KEY LPG SUPPLIER TO JAPAN
  Saudi Arabia is likely to remain the key
  supplier of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to Japan for at least
  the next five years, oil industry sources said.
      Japan, while diversifying its supply sources of propane and
  butane for stable supplies, will continue to bank on Saudi
  Arabian LPG, the sources said.
      They said Saudi's supply capabilities of LPG, an associate
  of crude oil, is guaranteed by its crude output capacity. ""Saudi
  is a reliable supplier in that sense,"" said one trader.
      Japan imports about 50 pct of its LPG from Saudi Arabia.
      No single nation could substitute for Saudi Arabia as an
  LPG supply source to Japan, the sources said.
      ""Saudi Arabia has committed itself to Japanese LPG buyers,
  which has quelled fears that LPG supplies from the Mideast Gulf
  could easily be disrupted in the wake of heightened hostilities
  in that area,"" said another trader.
      Saudi Arabia cut LPG shipments to Japan and elsewhere by 20
  pct in September after a fire put a major gas plant at
  Al-Juaimah out of operation. October shipments were back to
  contractual volumes as Saudi was able to boost exports from
  other ports.
      Attacks on Gulf shipping by Iran and Iraq centered on crude
  rather than products carriers, which has lulled fears of LPG
  supply disruptions, traders said.
      They said an Iranian blockade of the Strait of Hormuz was
  unlikely because it would block Iran's oil shipments.
      Industry sources said Japan's LPG imports will not greatly
  rise or fall as its domestic demand growth is estimated at a
  moderate 2.1 pct a year from 1986 through 1991.
      Japanese term buyers of Saudi LPG are expected to lift
  slightly lower volumes from January 1987, when imports from
  Indonesia are slated to increase, the sources said.
      The customers are unlikely to slash Saudi term purchases in
  large scale when Japan increases annual imports of Indonesian
  LPG to 1.95 mln tonnes in early 1989 from 319,000 tonnes in the
  year ended March 1987, the sources said.
      But when demand is sluggish in summer, they will phase down
  term purchases of Saudi LPG and secure lower-priced cargoes on
  the spot market, they said.
      Japan imports some 12 mln tonnes of LPG a year, of which
  5.3 mln tonnes are supplied by Saudi Arabia, 3.3 mln under term
  contracts and two mln through spot purchases. Some 80 pct of
  Japan's LPG imports are from the Middle East.
      Saudi Arabia's state owned oil company Petromin has made
  some concessions on term prices to Japanese customers in the
  recent round of contract renewal talks, and it is likely the
  Japanese will accept the offer, the sources said.
      The Japanese term customers, however, have so far been
  unsuccessful in establishing a transparent price formula to
  replace the existing unilateral monthly price notice.
      Japanese buyers pay Saudi Arabia a price notified by
  Petromin each month. Most recently the FOB price was set at 87
  pct of the 17.52 dlrs per barrel government selling price (GSP)
  of Arabian Light.
      Buyers reserve the right to phase down or out liftings
  should the monthly price be set at over 95 pct of Arabian
  Light's GSP.
      Petromin has offered to lower this rate to 90 pct from the
  95 pct for contracts with Japanese customers from next January,
  the trade sources said.
      Petromin also suggested that a seller's option of supplying
  up to 20 pct more than the contractural volume be subject to
  seller-buyer agreement.
      Under the present contract, Petromin can automatically cut
  supplies up to 10 pct of the contractual volume.
      ""If you want to import LPG from Saudi Arabia on a profitable
  basis, you have to set the price factor at 80 to 85 pct,"" said
  an official at a major importer. ""Freight costs are higher for
  cargoes coming from the Gulf than Southeast Asia due to a
  longer haul and war risk insurance payments.""
      Japanese customers will visit Saudi Arabia this month to
  finalise their separate contract talks, now focusing on
  contractual period and volume, which could be very similar to
  current levels, the sources said. ""When we talk business, we
  would seek profitability and sometimes forget vulnerability of
  high dependence on a single supplier,"" said one.

"NEW RUBBER PACT APPEARS IN THE BALANCE
  Negotiations on a new International
  Natural Rubber Agreement, INRA, are approaching the
  make-or-break point and prospects for a future pact appear to
  be in the balance, delegates said.
      Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, chairman of the INRA
  renegotiation conference, is holding consultations with a small
  group of producers and consumers to try to resolve major
  outstanding issues. When the talks began on Monday Xuto said
  those issues should be settled by the end of the first week to
  allow time to draft an agreement during the second week.
      The talks are due to last until March 20.
      Xuto said, ""There is nothing concrete yet, but the
  atmosphere is good."" The discussions are expected to continue
  late into the night, and Xuto said he may hold weekend
  meetings.
      Delegates said negotiations now focus on the degree to
  which price adjustments should be automatic.
      At present, if the market price has been above or below the
  reference price (set at 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kilo
  in the current agreement) for six months, the reference price
  is revised by five pct or by an amount decided by the
  International Natural Rubber Organisation council.
      Consumers are asking that, in these circumstances, the
  adjustment be automatic at five pct or more.
      Producers want the council to have the last word and have
  resisted reducing its role in the price adjustment procedure.
      Delegates said there seems to be optimism about settling
  another issue -- that of the floor price.
      It now appears that consumers may consider dropping their
  insistence of a downward adjustment of the floor price, called
  the ""lower indicative price,"" under certain circumstances.
      This means that any possible compromise would centre on the
  reference price, and the ""may buy"" (or ""may sell"") and ""must buy"" or
  ""must sell"" levels, without changing the ""lower indicative price""
  -- which is set at 150 Malaysian/Singapore cents in the current
  pact.
      Delegates said that in exchange for consumer flexibility on
  the floor price question, producers may consider agreeing to
  another consumer proposal for more frequent price reviews -- at
  12 month intervals instead of 18 at present.

"BAKER SEEN WINNING GERMAN INTEREST RATES BATTLE
  The United States appears to have won a
  transatlantic battle by forcing the Bundesbank to trim interest
  rates, European economists said.
      But they added Washington set the stakes high by testing
  the limits of the Louvre accord while global stock markets were
  plunging.
      West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg and U.S.
  Treasury Secretary James Baker reaffirmed their commitment to
  currency stability at a secret meeting yesterday in Frankfurt,
  according to official statements released late Monday.
      Only 13 hours after the statements were released, the
  Bundesbank reduced short-term interest rates by offering banks
  liquidity at a fixed bid rate of 3.80 pct, down from a 3.85 pct
  facility rate offered last week.
      While the two ministers were meeting with Bundesbank
  president Karl Otto Poehl, the central bank had also added
  money market liquidity repeatedly, signalling it did not want a
  strong rise in the tender allocation rate on Tuesday.
       ""It's round one to the Americans, "" said Richard Reid,
  senior European economist for brokers UBS/Philips and Drew in
  London.
      But Reid added, ""We shouldn't forget that it has taken one
  of the biggest stock market crashes in decades to get the West
  Germans to cut their security repurchase rate by a 0.05
  percentage point.""
      Over the weekend, criticism by Baker of earlier tightening
  of West German monetary policy led to a sharp dollar fall and
  fuelled speculation that the Louvre accord was no longer valid.
      Six leading industrial nations agreed under February's
  Louvre Accord to stabilise currencies and coordinate monetary
  policies. It has since been reaffirmed by the Group of Seven -
  the US, Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
      The Frankfurt meeting on Monday soothed currency markets
  and the dollar gained over two pfennigs in after hours trading
  in New York. At the Frankfurt fixing on Tuesday, the dollar was
  quoted at 1.7918 marks compared with 1.7740 on Monday.
      Guenther Aschoff, chief economist at Deutsche
  Genossenschaftbank in Frankfurt said massive declines on world
  stock markets had been the main reason for the fall in West
  German short-term interest rates on Tuesday.
      ""The Bundesbank wanted to set a marker after stock market
  losses... That was the responsible thing to do and if it fits
  with Baker's wishes, then all the better,"" he said.
      No central bank wants to let interest rates rise, and the
  Bundesbank had been forced to put its rates up following rises
  in the U.S., Aschoff said.
      Poehl told a conference in Frankfurt on Tuesday the central
  bank has no interest in higher capital market rates and he
  thought the global rate increase was a cause for concern.
      Giles Keating, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston
  Ltd in London said ""The cautious Bundesbank has beaten a retreat
  and Baker has won a battle...But he hasn't won the war as the
  security repurchase rate is still 20 points higher than it was
  before the IMF meeting last month in Washington.""
      Before the IMF meeting, when the Louvre Accord was
  reaffirmed, the Bundesbank was offering money market liquidity
  at 3.60 pct, Keating noted.
      Economists said the United States now appeared to have
  agreed to play by the rules of the Louvre Accord and support
  the dollar in return for the German action on interest rates.
      Any further sharp decline of the dollar would hinder
  Washington's efforts to reduce its trade deficit, Stoltenberg
  told a news conference on Tuesday. He added he would not rule
  out central banks of leading industrial countries intervening
  on exchange markets to defend the dollar's value.
      Deutsche Genossenschaftbank's Aschoff stressed West
  Germany's heavy dependence on exports and the need for currency
  stability. In addition, both the U.S. And West German central
  banks were keen to avoid a dollar slide which would force them
  to again spend vast sums intervening to support the dollar.

"INDONESIA LIMITS OIL PRICE IMPACT-FINANCE MINISTER
  Indonesia has minimised the economic
  impact of falling oil prices, kept inflation within limits and
  boosted exports, Finance Minister Radius Prawiro said.
      Indonesia was badly hit by last year's steep plunge in
  crude prices, which cut revenue from oil exports by half.
      But Prawiro was quoted by Indonesian newspapers as telling
  President Suharto that inflation was kept to around nine pct in
  the financial year ending tomorrow, against around 4.3 pct the
  previous year.
      Exports were estimated to have risen by seven pct, he said,
  although he did not give complete figures.
      The depressed economy forms the main backdrop to general
  elections next month in Indonesia, a major producer of rubber,
  palm oil, tin, timber and coffee.
      Prawiro said 1986/87 had also been difficult because of the
  appreciation of currencies like the yen and the mark against
  the dollar, which increased Indonesia's debt repayments.
      He said the economy would have suffered more from the world
  economic recession if the government had not devalued the
  rupiah by 31 pct last September.
      In an editorial on the economic outlook, the Jakarta Post
  said the government must press ahead with measures to
  deregulate the economy to help boost non-oil exports.
      The English-language daily said bigger export earnings were
  needed to finance not only imports but also the country's
  growing foreign debt, estimated at around 37 billion dlrs.
      ""About 50 pct of our foreign debt obligations fall due
  within the next three to five years and will steadily increase
  the debt servicing burden,"" the paper said.
      However, end-investors were seen bargain hunting in
  expectation of a further yen interest rate decline, dealers
  said.
      Most dealers were cautious in the face of the dollar's
  nosedive today and the possibility of a U.S. Interest rate
  rebound to halt further dollar depreciation.
      A 4.7 pct coupon and volume of 1,400 billion yen for the
  April 10-year bond proposed by the Finance Ministry this
  afternoon were taken favourably by the market.

"CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S.
  China called on the United States to
  remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading
  status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.
      But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing
  13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are
  inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade
  Congress to change laws which limit its exports.
       The official International Business newspaper today
  published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the
  visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.
       ""It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its
  restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities
  for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese
  exports,"" the editorial said.
       ""The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against
  favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China
  into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).
       ""Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in
  recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and
  influences normal trade between the two countries,"" it added
       The paper also printed an article by China's commercial
  counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said
  that ""all kinds of difficulties and restrictions"" were preventing
  bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.
       He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on
  technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.
       The paper also printed a table showing that, since
  bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every
  year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits
  at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.
       A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept
  Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude
  goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While
  U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.
       He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will
  have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several
  laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.
       The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP,
  China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and
  Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and ""not be
  dominated or controlled by international Communism.""
       The official said China was well aware of the laws, some
  of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that
  there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change
  them.
       China has been the subject of about a dozen cases
  involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years,
  which the U.S. Side won, he said.
       But, for the first time, China signed last week an
  agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain
  exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may
  lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.
       Another diplomat said willingness to provide such
  voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in
  bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.
       ""China has the potential to disrupt world markets,
  especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous
  about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other
  centralled planned economies in GATT,"" the diplomat said.
       Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of
  GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports
  or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.
       In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S.
  Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed
  China's interest in participating in GATT.
       ""The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished
  overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large
  economy of the Chinese type,"" Shultz said.
       ""China can play an important role by actively joining GATT
  discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and
  enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further
  develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum
  benefit from its GATT participation,"" he said.
       The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership
  are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen
  regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially
  for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.
       In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT
  last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic
  system and replacing mandatory instruction with ""guidance
  planning"" and economic levers.
       The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to
  do.

"MIYAZAWA SAYS MAJOR NATIONS ACTING ON PARIS ACCORD
  Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
  major nations are taking action to stabilise exchange rates in
  line with their agreement in Paris last month, government
  sources said.
      Miyazawa told an Upper House session the six nations --
  Britain, Canada, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany --

      Asked if the six nations had agreed to stabilise the dollar
  at about 153 yen, the rate prevailing at the time of the Paris
  talks, Miyazawa declined to give specific figures and said any

"ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS
  Ecuador will use a new pipeline link
  with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
  Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
      The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
  allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
  by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
      Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
  OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
  contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
  mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
      The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
  signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
  of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
  will begin in September.
      ""The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
  for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
  possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
  per day (bpd) will be pumped along it,"" Perry said.
      Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
  through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
  per barrel during the first year.
      The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
  run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle
  oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the
  Pacific port of Tumaco.
      Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the
  Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for
  Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was ""insignificant compared
  with what we are going to earn.""
      OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before
  the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln
  dlrs per month, Espinosa said.

"BAKER &lt;BKO> SUES TO FORCE HUGHES &lt;HT> MERGER
  Baker International corp said it has
  filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co
  to complete its proposed merger with Baker.
      Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger
  agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative
  divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had
  previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent
  decree that would have required broader divestitures.
      Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation
  from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice
  Department consent decree.
      Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
  shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
  counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote
  was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
      Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
  merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were ""more
  burdensome"" than those of the consent decree themselves.
      Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
  reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
  or three pct.
      Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
  the units named in the consent decree.
      It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of
  its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to
  live up to the merger agreement or ""substantial"" monetary
  damages it did not name.
      Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best
  interests of shareholders of both companies.

  Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5
  mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments

  Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.
      Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
  connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of
  Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.
      Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a
  total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export
  commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude
  and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.
       Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its
  exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that
  would take an estimated five  months.
      Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for
  refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would
  repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.
      Both countries are the only Latin American members of the
  Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).

      ""First, the national treasury should be in sound shape when

  Saturday.
      ""The second priority is to maintain an acceptable level of

      The figure was sharply lower than the 1.02 billion dinars

  the yendollar rate remains at the present level, managing
  director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.
      Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending
  March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from
  April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.
      Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550

  in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from
  a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.
      The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent
  appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market
  prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.
      The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,

  Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000
  from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000
  from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from
  1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one

      Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs
  sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.
  Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three

"WALL STREET STOCKS/CHRYSLER &lt;C>, AMC &lt;AMO>
  The proposed 757 mln dlr deal under
  which Chrysler Corp would acquire American Motors Corp was
  described by analysts as a reasonable deal for both companies.
      Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said AMC common
  stock could be fairly valued at ""just under five dlrs a share""
  given changes brought by tax reform and that Chrysler's offer
  to pay four dlrs a share of Chrysler stock to AMC holders other
  than Renault as a ""a good price for Chrysler.
      AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after
  the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chrysler
  shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4.
      Though AMC issued a statement saying that it was studying
  the proposed buyout and had no other comment, Glantz said he
  regarded the proposal as a ""done deal"" because ""I can't believe
  anybody else would make a bid.""
      ""It's a reasonable deal for both sides,"" the analyst told
  Reuters.
      ""Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC)
  Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier

  manufacturing capacity, including a brand-new plant in Canada,
  for a bargain price and Renault would be getting some return
  after its prolonged loss-making investment in AMC.

"LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER
  A leaf disease affecting seven pct of
  Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and
  raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and
  researchers told Reuters.
      About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber
  Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus
  ""corenes pora"" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the
  leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago.
      Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the
  crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.
  Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000
  tonnes.
      Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber
  clones if no immediate action is taken.
      ""The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees
  seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use
  chemicals to kill the disease,"" an Institute spokesman said.
      Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at
  Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the
  fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State
  Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.
      The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber
  land with the balance belonging to small private producers with
  a total of 145,600 hectares.
      The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research
  Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for
  planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these
  clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older
  PBX Malaysian clones.
      Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided
  to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be
  treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.
      Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week
  but prices had hit their lowest since last December. ""If there
  is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise,"" a spokesman
  for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.
      Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about
  four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe
  one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this
  week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same
  period.
      Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average
  of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in
  December because of wintering in early February in producing
  areas.
      Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with
  the supply position showing improvements.
      Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last
  month did not raise prices as on previous occasions.
      ""Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks,
  meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of
  the rubber we already had,"" one buyer said.
      Other sources said there were few forward contracts and
  speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals
  aggravated the problem.
      European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter
  closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would
  ease further.
      They said another problem that could hit the industry is
  the dry spell in producing areas. ""If the inter-monsoonal rains
  expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further
  shortages,"" one official said.
      ""But this again could benefit prices,"" a buyer said.

"ARISTECH &lt;ARS> SAYS 1ST QTR SHR ESTIMATE RIGHT
  Aristech Chemical Corp chairman and

  estimates of its 1987 fiscal year earnings of 2.25 dlrs to 2.50
  dlrs per share are about right.
      Addressing a gathering of analysts and institutional
  investors, Marshall also said that analysts' estimates of its
  first qtr earnings - 50 cts to 55 cts per share - were ""in the
  ballpark.""
      Marshall said the full year estimates represent more than a
  32 pct increase over 1986's fiscal year net of 1.70 dlrs per
  share.
      He also said the first quarter estimates were 70 pct higher
  than 1986's first quarter net of 29 cts per share.
  Marshall attributibuted the first quarter earnings growth to
  several factors, including sustained demand in Aristech's major
  domestic markets and continued growth in exports.
      Aristech plans to spend approximately 200 mln dlrs over in
  capital investments over the next three years, Marshall added.

"HUGHES &lt;HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT
  A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed
  Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a
  proposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO>, Wall
  Street analysts said.
      Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was
  off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from
  Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said
  it was still interested in the merger.
      The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its
  troubles could make it a takeover candidate.
      There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas
  investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters
  he is not interested.
      Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities
  and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in
  some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the
  target other than to rule out Hughes.
      One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes
  turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of
  Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the
  Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.
      Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a
  merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile,
  analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was
  going.
      ""I think the merger is not going through,"" said Phil Pace,
  analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger ""lost a
  lot of its appeal"" when the U.S. Department of Justice required
  that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.
      Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of
  the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said ""30 to 40
  pct of the cost savings are tied up in that.""
      ""They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,""
  said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
  ""Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but
  whether they will alter their position, I don't know.
      ""It's getting a little confusing,"" said James Carroll,
  analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited
  by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger ""tend to be weak.""
  Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it
  wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,
  the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer
  period of time.
      Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the
  companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker
  apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.
      Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln
  dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling
  Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be
  saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.
      Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first
  signed ""the outlook for the industry has improved materially.""
  Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry
  is lifting.

"CBI SURVEY POINTS TO SURGE IN U.K. OUTPUT
  British manufacturers expect output to
  grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of
  British Industry (CBI) survey shows.
      The CBI's monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct
  of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the
  next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47
  pct said production would likely remain unchanged.
      The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting
  production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was
  the highest such figure recorded since 1977.
      In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected
  a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain
  at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.
      The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies
  consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct
  view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below
  normal.
      This was the highest positive balance since the question
  was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.
      In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct
  respectively.
      Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of
  all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to
  be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only
  23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.
      In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below
  normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct,
  the proportion of companies rating their export books above
  normal was unchanged between February and March.
      On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies
  expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will
  remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in
  February.
      From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect
  prices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall,
  against four pct a month earlier.
      Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee
  chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling's more competitive
  level against many European currencies had improved exports.
      ""But interest rates are still much higher than in our
  competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have
  to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and
  in the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at
  home,"" he said.

      If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and
  developing two other French plants, either in the maize or
  wheat starch sector.
      Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion
  for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its

"COFFEE FUTURES UNDER DLR A POUND AT SIX-YEAR LOW
  Coffee futures dipped further and closed
  below one dlr a pound for the first time in six years.
      Coffee for delivery in May ended at 99.28 cents a pound on
  the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, down 0.76 cent
  and the lowest price since August, 1981.
       Prices have fallen steadily since the International Coffee
  Organization failed in February to reach an agreement
  controlling exports by its members, and pressure was renewed
  this week as the executive board of the organization met in
  London without reopening debate on its export quotas.
      The executive board has limited its current discussions to
  administrative matters and is set to adourn Thursday.
      Burdensome supplies have pressed the market down from 1.30
  dlrs a pound in February, when the organization's discussions
  aimed at re-establishing export quotas broke down.
      Sandra Kaul, a coffee analyst in New York with Shearson
  Lehman Brothers, said supplies currently are at their high
  point for the year because most producing nations have just
  completed their harvests.
      In addition, she said, many of those nations are faced with
  serious debt and need to sell coffee to raise capital.
      ""This should keep substantial pressure on exporters to
  undertake sales despite the drop in prices,"" she said.
      Further, U.S. demand could be sluggish because winter, the
  period of greatest consumption, is ending. Prices could fall
  another 10 to 15 cents a pound, analysts said.
      Gold futures retreated from modest early gains and closed
  steady while silver prices rallied on the Commodity Exchange in
  New York.
      The increase in U.S. banks' prime rates prompted concern
  about renewed inflation but the strength of the U.S. dollar
  discouraged new buying.
      ""The market is getting mixed signals and it doesn't know
  which way to go,"" one analyst said.
      Cattle futures posted new highs on the Chicago Mercantile
  Exchange, while live hogs rallied from early losses and frozen
  pork bellies finished sharply lower.
      Cattle prices continued to draw support from the winter
  storm that swept the Plains states, leaving animals stranded in
  snowbound fields and feed lots in miserable condition.
      Live hogs were pressured early by the Agriculture
  Department's report Tuesday that producers expanded their
  breeding herds more than the market expected last quarter.
  Prices recovered to keep pace with higher cash prices.
      Frozen pork bellies fell sharply on the outlook for greater
  production and closed with limit losses.
      Soybean futures posted sharp gains on the Chicago Board of
  Trade, while corn and wheat were lower.
      Soybeans rallied in response to Tuesday's USDA report that
  farmers intend to plant 56.9 mln acres this year, down from
  61.5 mln planted last year.
      Corn prices were pressured by the outlook for 67.6 mln
  acres of corn, which is down from last year's 76.7 mln acres,
  but was larger than analysts expected.

      The offer would be on the basis of three Willis shares for

      Willis already owns 2.05 mln shares, or 4.62 pct, and has

      The companies said the proposed merger would bring together
  businesses that were largely complementary. Both believed the

      Following the merger, the two companies saw significant
  opportunities for growth in brokerage income and considerable

"EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY
  The maximum export rebate granted at
  yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over
  producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC
  intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC
  Commission sources said.
      The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for
  118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous
  week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.
      Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to
  obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one
  Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week,
  the sources said.
      They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had
  to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from
  operators protesting that rebates are too low.
      Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar.
  But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless

"EXTRACTS FROM OPEC COMMUNIQUE
  Following are extracts from the
  communique issued at the conclusion of the OPEC conference
  here.
      ""The conference expressed satisfaction about the positive
  results of the agreement signed in December, 1986, by which
  OPEC re-established the system of fixed price at a level of 18
  dlrs per barrel supported by OPEC production ceilings
  distributed into national production levels.
      ""The conference noted that all market indicators, including
  spot prices in the market and netback values of all OPEC
  crudes, have been firming up significantly, thus consolidating
  the OPEC price structure as defined by the agreement.""
      ""The conference examined the supply/demand outlook for the
  second half of the year and decided that in order to secure
  continued firm prices in the market, OPEC production during the
  fourth quarter of 1987 will be equal to that of the third
  quarter, I.E. 16.6 mln barrels per day (bpd), distributed into
  the same national production levels as were defined by the
  above-mentioned agreement for that quarter.""
      ""Furthermore, the conference decided to establish a
  committee of five heads of delegation to monitor the price
  evolution in the market in relation to the OPEC official prices
  in order to secure price stability around the opec price
  structure.
      ""Should there be any significant change in market prices,
  the committee would immediately call for an extraordinary
  meeting of the conference with a view to deciding on the
  necessary OPEC production levels during the second half of the
  year, which would secure the desired market stability.""
      ""The conference reiterated the necessity of member
  countries' strict adherence to the agreement signed in December
  1986, both in terms of official price, and national production,
  levels.
      ""For this purpose, the conference decided to establish a
  committee of three heads of delegation to undertake visits to
  member countries in order to motivate them to comply with the
  terms of the agreement.""
  
      ""Moreover, the conference stressed the necessity of the
  cooperation of the oil-producing exporting countries outside
  OPEC as an essential prerequisite for a lasting market
  stability.
      The conference, therefore, decided to reinstate the group
  of five heads of delegation established by the 77th
  (extraordinary) meeting of the conference in April, 1986 to
  undertake the necessary contacts with those countries.
      ""The conference observed the continued fall in the value of
  the U.S. Dollar and agreed that the matter should be studied
  and reported to the next meeting of the conference.""
  
      ""The conference discussed the appointment of the secretary
  general and decided to discuss the matter again in its next

"EXCHANGE RATES ALMOST WITHIN G-6 LEVELS - SUMITA
  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita
  said that current exchange rates are almost within the levels
  agreed to by six major nations last month in Paris.
      Asked whether a dollar/yen rate of 148 or 149 reflected
  economic fundamentals, he said current rates almost reflect
  fundamentals.
      Sumita told reporters major nations have cooperated to
  bring about currency stability in line with the Paris
  agreement, which stipulated that they would closely cooperate
  to that end. He repeated the central bank will intervene if
  necessary, adding he did not think a dollar free-fall was
  likely.
      But Sumita said he could not say exactly what currency
  levels would be considered in line with underlying economic
  fundamentals.
      In Paris on February 22, Britain, Canada, France, Japan,
  the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate to hold
  currencies around their then current levels.
      Sumita said he could not find any specific reasons behind
  the fall of the dollar to a record low against the yen
  yesterday. But he said the market rushed to sell dollars as it
  nervously reacted to statements abroad and to developments
  surrounding trade tensions.
      U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said over the weekend
  that the Paris pact did not encompass fixed tragets for the
  dollar. U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter called
  U.S/Japan relations on certain key trade issues very strained.
      The market reacted nervously because the dollar has been
  moving narrowly against the yen since mid-January, Sumita said.
  He added he does not expect the yen/dollar exchange rate to
  remain unstable because the market is concerned about a sharp
  rise of the yen.
      The Bank of Japan will keep a close watch on exchange rates
  in line with the Paris accord, he added.

"SOYBEAN GROUP HEAD URGES USDA ACTION ON LOAN
  The Agriculture Department must make
  a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan
  or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the
  government and foreign soybean production will increase, the
  president of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.
      ""The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another
  ... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as
  much as they want, but they have to eventually address this
  problem,"" David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters.
      USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and
  Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the
  soybean loan, Haggard said.
      ""I don't know if USDA is really very serious about
  addressing the soybean loan problem,"" he said.
      At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA
  leaders refused to change their official position on the  loan
  -- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.
      The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson,
  R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a
  5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.
      Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed
  proposals have but said, ""in all honesty, we do not want to see
  the farm bill be torn apart.""
      He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to
  a market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could
  change the loan without new legislation.
      Making the loan partially in certificates which would not
  have to be paid back would be one option, he said.

  them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be
  their gain.
      The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on
  imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in
  retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not
  to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.
      Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs
  at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms
  said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the
  new taxes.
      ""We wouldn't be able to do business,"" said a spokesman for
  leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric
  Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.
      ""If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time
  beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of
  exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.,"" said Tom
  Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James
  Capel and Co>.
      In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.
      ""We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against
  Japan because it serves as a warning to us,"" said a senior
  Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.
      Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last
  year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.
      The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves
  to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.
      ""We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and
  cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we
  want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation,"" said
  Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.
      A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion
  association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan
  might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports
  are similar to those of Japan.
      Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion
  dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.
      In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough
  curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of
  semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the
  U.S.
      In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been
  selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics
  manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such
  a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by
  further U.S. Pressure to block imports.
      ""That is a very short-term view,"" said Lawrence Mills,
  director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.
      ""If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will
  be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong
  is the disadvantage of action restraining trade,"" he said.
      The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market,
  accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.
      The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade
  talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern,
  Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.
      ""This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two
  countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very
  serious matter,"" Button said.
      He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef,
  Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant
  U.S. Exports to that country.
      Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the
  trade stand-off continue.
      Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined
  a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.
      The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget
  and record public works spending in the first half of the
  financial year.
      They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency
  measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister
  Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.
      Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto
  Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and
  Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an
  effort to end the dispute.

"U.S. MARCH RETAIL SALES CUT BY LATE EASTER
  U.S. retailers' lackluster March sales
  were due to a late Easter, according to analysts who expect a
  recovery in April.
      ""Sales look soft because of the Easter shift, but
  underlying business is better than the numbers indicate,"" said
  Bear Stearns analyst Monroe Greenstein.
       Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
  April to account for the variation of Easter's occurance. This
  year, Easter is being observed on April 19, which is three
  weeks later than last year.
      Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
  sales for March rose an unadjusted 2.5 to 3.0 pct, and a
  seasonally adjusted 5.5 pct to six pct, compared to an adjusted
  5.7 pct last year.
      ""The obvious question is whether these numbers indicate
  that the consumer activity is slowing, but it does not appear
  to be because liquidity and employment are rising,"" said
  analyst Jeff Edelman, analyst of Drexel Lambert and Burnham.
      Overall, analysts said first half sales are coming in
  according to expectations. Sales for all of 1987 are expected
  to rise about 5.5 pct to six pct, up a bit from 1986's rise.
       In March, sales of housewares, furniture and big ticket
  items were stronger than apparel sales, signaling to many
  analysts that apparel sales will be strong in April as the
  holiday nears.
      ""Sales gains in home appliances and home fashions reflect a
  continuing strength in the housing market,"" said Edward
  Brennan, chairman of Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> which reported an
  overall sales gain of 4.2 pct. Brennan said sales of women's
  sportswear were also excellent.
      ""Sears' total apparel sales was up only modestly, but even
  a modest improvement in apparel is a very good accomplishment
  due to the fact that most people will buy apparel in April,""
  said C.J. Lawrence analysts Harry Mortner. 
      J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> and Dayton Hudson Corp &lt;DH> were
  among the weaker performers with comparable stores sales
  declining 1.5 pct and 4.9 pct, respectively. Penney's store and
  catalog sales declined 1.3 pct overall and Dayton Hudson's
  overall sales rose 4.8 pct.
      Penney chairman William Howell said, ""Sales continued
  strong for catalog operations and, geographically, ranged from
  very active in the east to weak in the economically depressed
  southwest.""
      ""Penney's been shifting away from leisure time activity
  wear to other apparel lines, which yield higher profit margins,
  but are currently hurting sales,"" said Greenstein of Bear
  Stearns.
      Hudson chairman Kenneth Mackes cited the late Easter for
  the decline. Edelman of Drexel said that ""Hudson had a tougher
  comparison because it had an exceptionally good 1986.""
      Most analysts agreed that promotions are slightly lower
  than last year.
      ""Retailers are not planning for much - inventories are
  being kept lean, markdowns are lower than last year, but sales
  are coming through anyway,"" said CJ Analyst Harry Mortner.
      Mortner said he expects profits in the first quarter to  
  be better than he had originally expected in the beginning of
  the year.
      Most retailers report their first quarter in the middle of
  May.

"GERMAN MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH SLOWS IN FEBRUARY
  West Germany's money supply growth
  slowed in February after January's sharp rise but the trend is
  still definitely upward, the Bundesbank said in a statement.
      Growth in the traditionally broad M3 aggregate was only
  moderate in February. While cash in circulation, deposits with
  statutory withdrawal notice and sight deposits grew sharply,
  short-term time deposits fell after expanding unusually
  strongly in January.
      In the six months to February, M3, which excludes holdings
  of German non-banks abroad, grew at a seasonally adjusted
  annual rate of 8.5 pct after 9.8 in the six months to January.
      Compared with February 1986, M3 rose 7-1/2 pct.
      In the six months to February, M2, which excludes time
  deposits with statutory withdrawal notice, rose at a seasonally
  adjusted annual rate of 8.8 pct and M1, which consists of cash
  and sight deposits, rose seven pct.
      International transactions of non-banks again led to a
  significant inflow of funds, the Bundesbank said.
      Net claims of commercial banks and the Bundesbank against
  foreigners, refecting these foreign payments, increased by 9.1
  billion marks in February, little changed from January's rise.
      But in contrast to January, the dampening effect of the
  inflow on domestic credit demand outweighed the expansionary
  effect on money growth, the Bundesbank said.
      Outstanding bank credits to companies and private
  individuals remained virtually unchanged in February.
      A sharp drop in short-term company credits, which reflected
  the foreign funds inflow, was balanced by a moderate rise in
  long-term credits and a sharp rise in credits for securities.
      At the end of February total bank credits to the private
  sector were 4-1/2 pct above the February 1986 level.
      The effect of public authority cash movements on the money
  supply was slightly expansive, the Bundesbank said.
      Although banks acquired large amounts of public authority
  paper, public authorities drew down book credits at commercial
  banks and the Bundesbank.
      Capital formation strengthened in February and slowed money
  supply growth to a larger extent than in January.
      A total of 7.7 billion marks in long-term funds was placed
  with banks after 6.6 billion the previous month.

"DOME PETE&lt;DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN
  Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier
  reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier
  profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write
  downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in
  deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs.
      The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign
  exchange losses, the company said.
      ""The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses
  much of the progress the company has made in the two previous
  years,"" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.
      ""But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little
  bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome,"" chairman
  Macdonald said.
      ""It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the
  company's assets in today's economic environment, and the
  absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders
  on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued
  existence,"" he added.
      Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for
  restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs.
      Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated
  foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the
  uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan.
      Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining
  period of the loans to which they apply, it said.
      Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter
  reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20
  billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of
  305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a
  charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in
  the third quarter.
      Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge
  resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full
  cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of
  Chartered Accountants.
      The company said it previously determined a write down of
  conventional oil and gas properties was not required at
  September 30, under the previous method of calculating the
  limitation of oil and gas values.
      Dome said the most significant accounting change under the
  new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in
  calculations instead of escalating price forecasts.
      Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude
  the company from making an accurate estimate of future
  financing costs, which are used in the new accounting
  calculations, it said.
      As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10
  pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially
  conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities
  and Exchange Commission, the company said.
      Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural
  gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71
  billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.
      Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas
  operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion
  dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.
      Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of
  Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also
  contributed to the decline, it said.
      Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79
  pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago
  542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0
  mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.
      Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained
  at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and
  improvements in productivity.
      Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of
  lower domestic and export sales, it said.
      Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled
  86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.
      Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day
  from 591.0 mcf a day.

"WINTER WEATHER HURTS EAST GERMAN GRAIN - USDA
  Shifts from mild to very cold
  weather in East Germany damaged winter barley and late sown
  winter wheat in central regions and barley north of Berlin, the
  U.S. agricultural officer in East Berlin said.
      In a field report, the officer said indications were that
  winter kill might well be more than 100,000 hectares compared
  with 38,000 last year.
      He said the damage was probably more limited in southern
  and central regions and most widespread in the north.
      Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where
  little or no snow cover was present, he added.
      The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine
  during the day led to some heaving, particularly for well
  developed plants and for winter barley.
      Furthermore, as the ground surface thawed, some standing
  water occurred in the fields.
      The officer said repairing damage will probably call for
  special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and
  where stands are thin. Harrowing, as well as well-timed
  applications of nitrogen, will be necessary, he added.

"COLOMBIA HELPFUL BUT COFFEE QUOTAS UNCERTAIN--U.S.
  A U.S. government trade official
  responsible for coffee policy said prospects for an accord on

  efforts to bridge differences between producers and consumers.
      Jon Rosenbaum, an assistant U.S. trade representative just
  back from trade talks in Colombia, said most producing
  countries now accept some sort of standardized criteria must be
  agreed to reintroduce coffee quotas.
      ""There is one country which evidently still does not,""
  Rosenbaum said in an obvious reference to Brazil, which has
  been negative recently on a reintroduction of quotas.
      Rosenbaum said because of the stance of Brazil the outlook
  for an agreement to reintroduce coffee quotas at the September
  International Coffee Organization meeting is hard to predict.
      He said that during the visit to Bogota he held technical
  discussions with Colombian officials.
      While he did not meet with Jorge Cardenas, head of the
  Colombian coffee producers federation, who was in Europe,
  Cardenas left a ""positive letter,"" Rosenbaum said.
      The Cardenas letter responded to a U.S. letter last month
  which praised Colombia for trying to find a compromise formula
  for the reintroduction of quotas, but outlined several concerns
  with the technical details of the Colombian plan.
      Rosenbaum could not be reached later in the day for comment
  on a new formula for calculating ICO quotas agreed to by
  European coffee roasters and traders.
      Dutch coffee trade association chairman Frits van Horick
  said in Amsterdam the new formula is based on six year moving
  averages and would give Brazil an unchanged export quota for
  the remaining to years of the current coffee agreement.
      The U.S. has said it will not agree to any coffee quotas
  unless ""objective criteria"" which reflect recent changes in the
  coffee market are used to set export limits.

"TASS DENOUNCES U.S. ATTACK ON IRAN AS ADVENTURISM
  The official Soviet news agency Tass
  denounced a U.S. Attack on an Iranian oil-drilling platform in
  the Gulf on Monday as military adventurism and said it would
  bring no dividends to the Reagan administration.
      Tass commentator Mikhail Krutikhin said the administration
  had embarked on an adventurist path in order to deflect
  attention from the scandal in which the United States sold arms
  to Iran and the profits were diverted to Nicaraguan rebels.
      ""The confrontation is a fact now. What is obvious is that
  the latest military adventure will not bring political
  dividends to the American administration,"" Krutikhin said.
      Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard
  Shevardnadze abruptly left a parliamentary session earlier on
  Monday, sparking diplomatic speculation that they were
  concerned with an urgent matter of foreign affairs.
      Soviet officials have previously criticized the United
  States for sending naval forces into the Gulf, saying their
  presence serves to increase tension.
      Moscow is officially neutral in the war between Iran and
  Iraq. It is a major arms supplier to Iraq but has also sought
  broader contacts with Iran in the last year.
      Krutikhin said: ""The United States has undertaken an act of
  armed aggression against Iran, the probability of which has
  long been spoken of by Washington officials.""

"LYNG SAYS NO DECISION ON SOVIET EEP OFFER
  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
  Lyng said the Reagan administration had not decided on offering
  the Soviet Union subsidized wheat but that such an offer had
  not been ruled out.
      In an interview with Reuters, Lyng also said that he had no
  knowledge of any upcoming discussion of the matter within the

      Asked if the administration had ruled out offering to
  subsidize wheat exports to the Soviet Union under the
  department's export enhancement program, Lyng said, ""No. We
  haven't made a decision on it, haven't even talked about it,
  haven't even looked at it.""
      Reminded that there have been reports that Moscow would buy
  U.S. wheat if competitively priced, Lyng responded, ""If they
  (the Soviets) would offer to buy some wheat, would we accept
  it? It would depend on what price they offered.""
      Lyng added that he did not think the price of U.S. wheat
  was far off the world price.
      Asked about persistent speculation that the administration
  would offer Moscow a wheat subsidy, Lyng said, ""Some people

"NO IMMEDIATE PLANS TO CLOSE REFINERY - ESSO SAF
  ESSO SAF &lt;ESSF.PA>, the French subsidiary

  down one of its two refineries. Exxon's new president Lee R.
  Raymond said earlier that it could decide to close a French
  refinery.
      An ESSO SAF spokesman said a closure was a hypothesis that
  depended on the evolution of the market and refineries' ability
  to make money. He said Port Jerome west of Paris and Fos sur
  Mer on the Mediterranean had benefitted from new investment
  over 1985-86 and had last year broken even after stock losses.
      The Port Jerome refinery has an annual production capacity
  of seven mln tonnes while Fos sur Mer's is five mln, the
  spokesman added.
      Industry sources said the easiest plant to dispose of would
  be Fos sur Mer because it is a single refinery, while the Port
  Jerome refinery is attached to a wider complex comprising a
  petrochemical plant and a lubricant production plant.
      Raymond was quoted as saying in a published interview that

"JAPAN OPENS HOME MARKET TO U.S. FISH
  Japan has agreed to drop barriers to
  American-caught herring and pollock, opening the way for
  shipments that could reach 300 mln dlrs annually, U.S. Trade
  Representative Clayton Yeutter announced.
      Yeutter said the accord was reached after extensive
  bilateral negotiations that ended earlier today in Tokyo.
      He said the Commerce Department estimated U.S. shipments of
  processed pollock products and herring should rise to 85 mln
  dlrs this year and to more than 300 mln dlrs annually in later
  years.
      There was no immediate assessment of the value of current
  U.S. shipments, but officials said the pact would lift quotas
  to the point that Americans would be able to ship nearly all
  the pollock and herring ordered by Japanese firms.
      At the same time, Yeutter said Washington was temporarily
  suspending a complaint with the General Agreement on Tariffs
  and Trade (GATT) that Japan was unfairly curbing imports of the
  two fish.
      He said the complaint would be reviewed later this year
  after an assessment to see if Japan lived up to the agreement.

  Grain trade representatives continued
  to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer

  Department officials said there was no substance to the
  reports.
      ""It's pure fiction,"" said one senior official at USDA's
  Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the
  administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow
  in the next two to three weeks.
      An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not

  speculation, which he said was started by ""somebody fanning the
  (wheat) market."" Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the
  basis of the speculation.

  administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain
  trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as
  much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before
  mid-year, if it was ""competitively priced.""
      Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading
  organization, told Reuters he had no information to
  substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but
  said that Moscow ""would consider"" buying U.S. wheat if it was

"TAFT&lt;TFB> BIDDERS WOULD SELL ENTERTAINMENT UNIT
  A proposed buyout of Taft Broadcasting
  Co by Dudley Taft and other investors includes a plan to sell
  the company's Entertainment Group, according to one of the
  investors.
      Jonathan Nelson, managing director of Narragansett Capital
  Corp &lt;NARR>, which is participating in the buyout plan,
  declined to say if buyers have already been lined up for the
  Entertainment Group. ""We are considering selling the group,""
  Nelson said. Wall Street analysts said any of the Hollywood
  film studios which might be interested.
      Taft Broadcasting Co did not comment on the 145 dlr per
  share offer. Taft has 9.2 mln shares outstanding, of which 12
  pct are owned by the Taft and Ingalls families.
      Dudley Taft relinquished the title of president in July but
  continues as vice chairman of the company.
      Taft-Narragansett requsted a response to its proposal by
  March 12.
      If the plan is accepted, Taft would be a private company
  financed by high yield bonds and bank debt, Nelson said.
  Narragansett is an investment management company specializing
  in leveraged buyout transactions.
      Taft shares climbed 19 to 151-1/2, causing arbitrageurs to
  say investors believe the bidders may raise their price.
      Robert M. Bass, who controls 25 pct of the stock, and
  American Financial Corp, holder of 15 pct, did not return
  telephohe calls seeking comment.
      But Dennis McAlpine, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, said ""I
  don't think it's worth 150 dlrs."" He noted Taft recently agreed
  to sell a group of independent television stations at a loss.
  He said the entertainment group, which includes the
  Hanna-Barbara animation studios, is currently hampered by a
  glut of animated product.
      Taft Broadcasting has never commented on reports that its
  major stockholders met recently to discuss a break-up of the
  company.
      MacAlpine said there are lots of options for reshaping the
  company with a distribution of various pieces to the major
  shareholders among the possibilities.
      Analyst Alan Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin
  Inc said the Bass group has been increasing its stake in the
  belief the company would be worth more with a change in its
  strategy. He said Bass pushed for sale of the independent
  television stations because the company paid too much.

"U.S. HOUSE PANEL APPROVES TRADE BILL
  The House Ways and Means Trade 
  Subcommittee unanimously approved a toned-down version of
  legislation designed to toughen U.S. trade laws and wedge open
  foreign markets to more U.S. goods.
      The measure now goes to the full House Ways and Means
  Committee next week, but major changes are not expected,
  congressional sources said.
      ""This product could very well be toughening our trade policy
  and doing it in a manner that opens markets without this
  frightening word 'protectionism',"" Ways and Means chairman Dan
  Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat said.
      The trade subcommittee backed away from mandating specific
  retaliation against foreign countries for unfair foreign trade
  practices as the House had approved in a trade bill last year.
      But it held over for the full Ways and Means Committee
  debate on a controversial plan by Rep. Richard Gephardt to
  mandate a reduction in trade surpluses with the U.S. by
  countries such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
      Gephardt, a Missouri Democrat, has not decided the exact
  form of his amendment, an aide said. Last year the House
  approved his idea to force an annual ten pct trade surplus cut
  by those countries. 
      The trade bill will be wrapped in with legislation from
  other committees dealing with relaxation of export controls,
  incentives for research, expanded worker training and education
  and other efforts to increase U.S. competitiveness.
      The comprehensive trade bill is to be considered by the
  full House in late April and then will be considered by Senate
  committees.
      It requires President Reagan to retaliate against foreign
  unfair trade practices but do not mandate quotas or tariffs and
  allow an exemption if U.S. economic security would be harmed by
  U.S. actions against other countries.
      The bill would make it easier for U.S. industries to win
  relief from surges of imports of competitive products.
      It extends until January 1993, the administration's
  authority to negotiate trade agreements as part of the new
  round of multilateral talks under the General Agreements on
  Tariffs and Trade.
      And, it includes provisions to tighten trade rules on
  copyrights, patents and telecommunications goods.

"U.K. RESERVES LIFT HOPES OF FURTHER BASE RATE CUT
  The record 4.9 billion dlrs rise in U.K.
  Reserves in May to a total 34.7 billion has lifted hopes for a
  further cut in bank base lending rates after the June 11
  general election, market analysts said.
      Sterling would have risen on the much better than expected
  number but for market nerves about the poll outcome, they said.
      But the weight of foreign currency and gold reserves now
  available to the authorities to support the pound should curb
  any market tendency to panic if U.K. Opinion polls show the
  ruling Conservative Party's lead slipping, they added.
      ""We have been intervening to a very much greater extent than
  we have done hitherto,"" Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson
  said at a news conference today, commenting on the news of the
  record reserves rise.
      He put the U.K. Intervention in the context of the Louvre
  accord between leading industrial nations to stabilise the
  dollar, partly through direct intervention on foreign
  exchanges. ""We have been playing a very full part ourselves,"" he
  said.
      But market analysts see the recent upward pressure on
  sterling, and consequent need for official sales to damp down
  its rise, more in the light of local factors.
      Steven Bell, chief economist at Morgan Grenfell Securities,
  said that corporate money has been flowing back into Britain
  amid hopes of another Conservative government, after fears last
  autumn of a Labour election victory sent it flooding out.
      U.K. Portfolio investment is also returning, while foreign
  buyers see U.K. Growth propects and high bond yields as
  attractive. They will be strong buyers of U.K. Assets, notably
  equities, once the election is out of the way, Bell said.
      Analysts see this pressure as the main hope for lower
  interest rates, as the government is expected to try to reverse
  the loss of export competitiveness caused by a strong pound.
      Today, however, the pound hardly moved on the reserves
  news, dipping on its trade-weighted index against a basket of
  currencies from 73.1 pct of its 1975 value at 1000 GMT to 73.0
  pct at 1100 GMT, half an hour after the figures were released.
      ""The market doesn't want to do anything because of the
  election,"" commented an economist at a big U.S. Investment bank.
      Several dealers and analysts added that market forecasts of
  a rise in reserves of between one and three billion dlrs had
  overestimated the amount of pound sales that were likely to
  have been disguised by swap arrangements or transactions on the
  forward market.
      The market also seemed to have overestimated the amount of
  sterling the Bank of England bought at the end of May to smooth
  the pound's sudden downturn, while some of the intervention
  reported in May probably occurred in April, they said.
      The key three months interbank money market rates eased
  about 1/8 point, reflecting cautious hopes that the downtrend
  in U.K. Interest rates will be revived following the reserves
  news, analysts said.
      Government bond prices initially firmed, but the market was
  muted as traders worried about the funding implications of
  another huge rise in reserves, they added.
      Morgan Grenfell's Bell forecast a half point base rate cut
  from the current nine pct level soon after the election, so
  long as poll projections of another Conservative victory prove
  accurate, with another half point later.
      Justin Silverton, equity economist at Credit Suisse
  Buckmaster and Moore, said a full point reduction might be
  possible. ""Sterling will be held down by interest rate cuts in
  future, rather than this active intervention,"" he predicted.
      Kevin Boakes of Greenwell Montagu Gilt-Edged cautioned
  against over-optimistic forecasts, but agreed a half point cut
  looked likely.
      A cut before the election has been virtually ruled out.
      ""The Bank (of England) is both worried about the political
  problem of cutting rates during an election campaign ... And
  has signalled some worry about broad money (growth),"" said Robin
  Marshall, chief U.K. Economist at Chase Manhattan Securities.
      He said the 10 billion dlrs increase in total reserves in
  the past seven months may foreshadow full U.K. Entry into the
  European Monetary System.
      But Bell said the authorities would like to see another 10
  or 15 billion dlrs in the reserves before joining, if they did
  so. But, unlike many analysts, he doubted the U.K. Will go in.

"BANK OF BOSTON &lt;BKB> SEES IMPROVED 1ST QUARTER
  Bank of Boston Corp expects first
  quarter earnings will range between 90 cts and one dlr a share,
  up from 79 cts a share last year, Chairman William Brown said.
      He told shareholders the company has a 190 mln dlr exposure
  in loans to Brazil if that country defaults on its debt
  payments. If a default does occur, it would first quarter
  earnings by about five cts a share, which would bring the
  bank's in the lower level of the estimated range, he added.
      Brown noted the 1986 first quarter net included a 17 cts
  gain from loan restructurings which will not appear this year.
      Brown said the bank's other nonperforming assets, not
  including its Brazilian exposure, could rise to over 700 mln
  dlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs a
  year earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986.
      He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loans
  which he expects will be ultimately repaid after the company
  recovers from an earthquake earlier this year.
      Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican and
  Venezuelan loans as those nations are also facing credit
  problems.
      Brown said the Bank of Boston remains ""cautiously optimitic
  about the full year even if our Brazilian exposure were to be
  on nonaccural all year."" In 1986, the bank earned 3.69 dlrs a
  share, or 232.8 mln dlrs on net interest revenues of 1.08
  billion dlrs.
      President Ira Stepanian told the shareholders's meeting the
  bank's total loans to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico totaled 875
  mln dlrs at the end of 1986, 37 pct of its primary capital.
  Brazil loans total 300 mln dlrs, of which about two-thirds are
  affected by its suspension of interest payments on its medium
  and long term foreign debt.

      It said exports over the period rose by 8.7 pct to 12.38

"SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR
  World group turnover of Siemens AG
  &lt;SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current
  year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five
  months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.
      Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02
  billion marks.
      Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to
  21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about
  19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due
  to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station
  which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.
      In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a
  three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.
      In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8
  billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.
      For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between
  one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.
      Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the
  communications and telecommunications sectors in particular
  should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.
      But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for
  1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the
  dollar, Kaske said.
      Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group
  net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the
  same period in the previous year.
      Turnover in the first five months rose particularly
  strongly in the installations and automotive technology,
  communications and telecommunications sectors, but components
  and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.
      Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in
  the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their
  level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by
  orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.
      Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An
  increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad
  was balanced by the decline in the dollar.
      While the installations and automotive technology sector
  showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and
  communications orders were below the level achieved in the same
  period of 1985/86.
      Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same
  level.
      Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six
  billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous
  year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to
  6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.

"MCI &lt;MCIC> PRESIDENT SEES PROFIT IMPROVEMENT

      He said American Telephone and Telegraph Co long-distance

"U.S. SEES MORE HARMONY IN TALKS WITH FRANCE
  The U.S. Expects more harmonious
  talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac's
  first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes
  between the two countries begin to fade.
      ""The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past, the trade war
  didn't happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation
  on terrorism,"" one U.S. Official told Reuters.
      ""It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect,
  more harmonious than usual.""
      Since taking office a year ago, Chirac has been obliged to
  deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the
  United States.
      During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in
  Libya last April, France refused to allow British-based U.S.
  Planes to overfly its territory, forcing them to take a
  circuitous route. That angered Washington.
      The U.S. Officials, who asked not to be identified, said a
  year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong
  enough action against terrorism. ""Now they are. We're pleased
  and they are pleased that we are pleased,"" one said.
      More recently, a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain
  markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European
  Community  threatened to become a trade war.
      In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate
  Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain, the United States was
  poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food
  imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.
      Last week, the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad,
  supported, trained and armed by Paris and Washington, scored a
  major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases
  in northern Chad.
      A French official added: ""There is also a common interest in
  getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the
  world by opening up its markets.""
      Although relations have improved markedly between the two
  countries, many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the
  Community's common agricultural policy (CAP).
      To Washington, as one official put it, ""CAP is the root of
  all evil"" in international food trade because it subsidises
  farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world
  prices, thereby eating into U.S. Markets.

      She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable and

  market was being regarded by her government as a test case.
      ""I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on the

"KUWAIT SAID SEEKING FOREIGN PROTECTION FOR OIL
  Kuwait has asked at least four
  countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
  and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to
  protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf,
  Reagan Administration officials said.
      The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait
  wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet
  registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new
  ""Silkworm"" missiles at superpower flags.
      The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to
  international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using

"NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY
  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change
  its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on
  Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have
  stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.
      Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's
  tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will
  be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining
  16 billion marks from the system.
      The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival
  festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will
  close banks here this afternoon.
      Because of the disruption to business from carnival,
  minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are
  unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their
  needs at the tender.
      Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough
  liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.
      But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings,
  the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks
  this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.
      ""I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount
  a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks,"" one dealer said.
      ""They would then stock it up at the next tender when the
  need is clearer,"" he added.
      An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion
  marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary
  drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.
      Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the
  Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just
  clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.
      Call money traded today at 3.85/95 pct, up from 3.80/90
  yesterday.

"VOLCKER DEPARTURE REVIVES DLR, INFLATION FEARS
  Paul Volcker's decision not to go for a
  third term as Federal Reserve Chairman and the nomination of
  Alan Greenspan to replace him have revived deep concerns about
  the U.S.' ability to prevent a further dollar decline and stem
  rising inflation, financial market analysts said.
      Although Greenspan is known as a committed anti-inflation
  fighter in the Volcker mould, doubts are already surfacing in
  the U.S. financial markets as to whether he has enough
  political clout and monetary experience to wage a tough
  campaign against inflation over the next year or two.
      ""The critical issue is how (Greenspan) will deal with
  inflation,"" said Stephen Axilrod, Vice Chairman of Nikko
  Securities Co International Inc and former staff director for

"CURRENCY FUTURES TO KEY OFF G-5, G-7 MEETINGS
  News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7
  finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key
  to the direction of currency futures at the International
  Monetary Market, but any such agreement will need to go beyond
  the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures, financial
  analysts said.
      ""If they (the finance ministers) give the market something
  really new to look at -- that is, some package that goes beyond
  the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the
  dollar,"" said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills.
      On the other hand, ""anything neutral would tend to be
  bearish for the dollar,"" Mills said.
      Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the
  Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the
  dollar, nor will central bank intervention.
      ""A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies
  and sell the dollar,"" said one trader for a large retail firm
  on the floor of the IMM.
      ""If there is no concrete resolution, they will be looking
  to sell the dollar, possibly down to the 1.80 mark level,"" he
  said.
      Technically, most currency futures are poised for another
  rise, said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane.
      Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high
  on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever, while June
  sterling set a new contract high on Monday.
      ""Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you
  don't need much to get things rolling,"" Sloane said.
      In particular, the June Canadian dollar, for which Sloane
  recently put out a buy recommendation, has hovered in a range
  between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks, forming a triangle
  on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside.
      A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a
  breakout, Sloane said, and would likely mean the nearby
  Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the
  0.7800 level. June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday.
      Mills noted, however, that interest rate differentials
  between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed
  dramatically recently, with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds
  only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes.
      What has helped the Canadian currency, she noted, is an
  increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the
  Canadian equity market, particularly from Japanese investors.
      Other analysts, however, said currency futures may be near
  the top of their long-term rally.
      ""Something will be done at the (G-5 and G-7) meeting to
  calm people,"" said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics.
      The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European
  currencies will trade, Horner said.
      But sterling futures may still make another run for new
  highs, up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract, on the
  positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections
  and possibly another interest rate cut, Horner said. The June
  British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday.
      Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of
  the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings.
      The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar
  between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152
  yen, Horner said. In yen futures, the bottom of the dollar's
  range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June
  contract. June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday.
      If such a range does emerge from the meetings, ""we will
  have one more rally in the yen,"" Horner said.

"BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM
  Borg-Warner &lt;BOR> Corp, facing an
  unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
  dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners Inc>.
      Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
  definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
  new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
  share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
  Borg-Warner common stock.
      The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
  remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
  54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
  discount debentures.
      As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
  owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
  members of management do not plan to participate in the
  transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
  company.
      A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
  19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
      GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
      Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
  sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
  about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
  a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
  stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
  values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
  speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
      In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
  Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
  shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
  advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
  said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
  with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
  employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
  strong presence in the Chicago community.""
      Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
  which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
  to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
  arrangements.
      The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
  51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
      Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
  provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
  subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
      Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
  commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
  financing required to complete the transaction.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
  the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
  cash interest after five years.
      The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
  for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
  102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
  of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
  the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
  maturity.
      Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
  dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
  share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
  convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
      The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
  poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
  effective immediately.

"TEXACO SEES BUSINESS LITTLE HIT BY BANKRUPTCY MOVE
  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> said its decision to
  file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
  code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
      It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
  32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
  plant and equipment, were free of the action.
      Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
  subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
  affected, it said.
      But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
  per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
  on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
      Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
  demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
  result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
      Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
  of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
  judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
  1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost
  matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
      Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
  to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
      Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
  Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
  the Texas courts.
      Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
  Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
  the Pennzoil lawsuit.
      ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
  issue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco's
  president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
      Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
  Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
  the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
      Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
  bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
  earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
  sell any assets, Kinnear said.
      Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
  credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
  11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
      Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
  company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
  Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
  bankruptcy.
      He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
  confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texaco
  told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
  to bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.
      Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
  prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
  ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

"VENEZUELA LOWERS EXCHANGE RATE FOR OIL EARNINGS
  Venezuela's cabinet approved a new
  exchange rate for oil and mining export earnings, setting it at
  14.50 bolivars to the dollar from 7.50 bolivars previously,
  Minister Manuel Azpur UA said.
      Azpur told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the
  measure is ""fundamental to conserving the economic and financial
  strength of the petroleum industry.""
       He said the new exchange rate, which goes before the
  central bank for final approval tommorrow, will allow the state
  oil company Petroleos De Venezuela, S.A.(PDVSA) to solve its
  problem of working capital and implement investment plans,
  estimated at 20 billion bolivars for 1987. He did not say when
  the measure would become effective.
     Venezuela's oil industry previously sold its dollar earnings
  to the government at 7.50 to the dollar but bought foreign
  exchange from its imports at 14.50 bolivars.
     The new exchange rate will promote purchases of domestic
  goods and services by the industry, Azpur said. He added that
  it would also put PDVSA in a position to purchase more
  government debt bonds.                        
      PDVSA had available liquid assets of 20 billion bolivars at
  the start of this year, of which nine billion were in a trust
  fund in the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV) and placed in
  government bonds.
    According to a contract between PDVSA and the central bank,
  the BCV must provide cash as the oil industry requries by
  repurchasing the bonds.
      PDVSA's contribution to the treasury last year was 44.480

"U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING
  U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain
  cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias
  as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the
  economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.
      Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains,
  that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will
  keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.
      Until trends are clearer, ""the market can only attempt to to
  establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest
  rates,"" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
      Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy
  said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy
  investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this
  environment until there is illumination of and confidence in
  U.S. Dollar/trade policy.
      Salomon Brothers' Henry Kaufman said the bond market,
  highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if
  currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas
  economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.
      ""The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these
  developments is likely to occur,"" Kaufman said.
      ""Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager
  confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while
  longer,"" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving
  Securities Corp.
      However, Braverman said that, ""from a longer term
  perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying
  opportunity.""
      Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on
  unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury
  bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and
  Thursday's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.
      Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long
  bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism.
  Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.
      The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a
  similar ""paroxysm of pessimism,"" the key bonds reached a similar
  closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance,
  however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the
  yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.
      Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said
  that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach
  nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.
      Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have
  spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and
  they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to
  persist over the next few months.
      Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers
  last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate
  rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by
  midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.
      ""Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the
  rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we've seen
  since the start of the year,"" Held said.
      Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.
      ""The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,"" said
  economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.
      They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up
  interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar
  and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm
  the fragile U.S. Economic expansion.
      The Lanston economists said, ""The Fed cannot ease its policy
  stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm
  domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of
  causing a further decline in the dollar.""
      Minutes of February's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)
  meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy
  unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy
  later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit
  markets warranted a policy shift.
      However, economists generally believe that continued fairly
  sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S.
  Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing
  countries rule out any Fed policy firming.
      There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at
  last Tuesday's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.
      This week's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little
  impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on
  Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.
      There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S.
  Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic
  indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A
  Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index's first
  quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP
  growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.
      Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are
  expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen.

"YEUTTER PUTS CURRENCY BURDEN ON TAIWAN, KOREA
  Responsibility for the appreciation of

      Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in
  those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of
  their currencies against the dollar.
      Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S.
  could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against
  the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits
  with Taiwain and Korea.
      ""An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports
  in the short term, but in the long run they have to be
  concerned about how they are perceived in the international
  business community,"" Yeutter said.
      For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade
  surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and
  with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend
  the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that
  country.
      He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move
  to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, ""otherwise in two
  or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that
  prevails in Taiwan.""
      Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50

"OECD CONSUMER PRICES RISE IN FEBRUARY
  Consumer prices in the countries of the
  Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
  rose 0.3 pct in February and inflation rose to 2.4 pct
  year-on-year, the OECD said in a communique.
      The OECD attributed the rise in consumer prices to the
  effects of the February 1986 drop in energy prices working
  their way out of the index. The February increase was less than
  Janauary's 0.4 pct increase but slightly above the average for
  the later months of 1986.
      Inflation in the 24 western industrialised nations in
  January was a revised 1.9 pct year-on-year. 
      Retail energy prices rose by 0.3 pct, less than January's
  1.1 pct increase. Energy prices for consumers were still nine
  pct lower than a year earlier, it said.
      Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 pct in
  February, in line with previous months, although there has been
  some acceleration noticeable in the U.S. And Britain.

"SQUIBB &lt;SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS
  Robert Fildes, president and chief
  executive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp
  is not interested in buying Cetus.
      Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a
  five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
      ""This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major
  majority holder in Cetus,"" Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
  ""Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
  want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
  of arrangement,"" said Fildes.
      Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
  by Fildes.
      Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
  one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK>
  and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but
  neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
      Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
  products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
      Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement 
  an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
  new biotechnology products in several fields.
     
      As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'
  anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
  Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
  not in North American and Western Europe.
      ""We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
  that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
  North America and Europe,"" said Fildes.
      He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a
  major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
  own in that market.
     
      Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
  pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
  business. Many large corporations have invested in small
  biotech firms.
      But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made
  in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus
  because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
  with a large number of other biotechnology companies.""
     
      Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
  areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to ""keep the
  biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.""
      Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to
  broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
  as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
  markets.
      Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research
  over the next five years.
     
      ""Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
  development to make it happen, while the equity position part
  of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
  partnership,"" said Fildes.

"LOWER U.S. SOYBEAN LOAN IDEA SHARPLY CRITICIZED
  U.S. soybean lobbyists and
  congressional aides criticized a proposal from a senior
  Agriculture Department official that Congress allow the U.S.
  soybean loan level to be officially lowered to 4.56 dlrs per
  bushel next year.
      ""I don't know who in Congress would propose that happening.
  Politically it would be totally unacceptable,"" an aide to a
  senior farm-state senator said.
      USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said this week that
  Congress should give USDA authority to keep the soybean loan 
  at its current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel rather
  than increasing it to its minimum allowed level of 4.77 dlrs.
      ""I'm convinced that Congress will not go along with this,""
  American Soybean Association President Dave Haggard said.
      Amstutz told reporters following a senate hearing that if
  the soybean loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider
  ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive.
      His comments were seen as possibly indicating what the  the
  administration's position is in the debate over what should be
  done to make soybeans competitive and at the same time protect
  soybean farmers' income.

  loan rate or implementation of a marketing loan have been
  pointed to as the most effective ways to get soybean prices
  competitive. USDA secretary Richard Lyng, however, continues to
  maintain his opposition to a marketing loan, saying such a move
  would be too costly.
      ""There will be alot of other options that will be
  considered before Congress looks at that one (the Amstutz
  proposal,"" said Bill O'Conner, aide to Rep. Edward Madigan
  (R-Ill), ranking minority leader of the Agriculture Committee.
      ""Anybody representing large groups of soybean producers
  would not be very excited about supporting a lower soybean
  loan,"" O'Conner said.
      Congress may very likely look at the soybean loan and
  decide that they cannot increase it from its current 5.02 dlr
  basic rate, but that there has to be something mandated to
  increase soybean's competitiveness, David Graves, aide to Sen.
  Thad Cochran (R-Miss) said. Cochran, a staunch supporter of a
  soybean marketing loan, would support a soybean loan of 5.02 or
  4.77 dlrs with a certificate buydown, Graves said.

"GERMAN FINANCIAL POLICY MAKERS IN RARE DISSENSION
  Karl Otto Poehl, head of West Germany's
  central bank, and Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg are
  normally so much in agreement that some foreigners doubt the
  central bank's independence.
      But a rare public row between the ebullient Poehl,
  president of the Bundesbank, and Stoltenberg, over a
  controversial investment tax proposal, has added to the woes of
  the country's already nervous financial markets, bankers said.
      Poehl told an investment symposium in Frankfurt last
  Thursday he feared the tax would raise borrowing costs and
  interest rates
      Stoltenberg quickly issued a statement rebutting Poehl's
  criticism, saying West Germany would remain an attractive place
  for foreign investors.
      ""The obvious lack of coordination between the Bundesbank and
  Finance Ministry does not instil confidence in foreign
  investors,"" said one economist for a London broker, who asked
  not to be identified.
      Bankers here expressed confidence the two top financial
  policy-makers would quickly patch up their relationship to
  steer the economy through a particularly difficult time.
      ""There are plenty of objective pressures which will result
  in things getting back to normal again after a period of ill
  feeling,"" said Commerzbank AG chief economist Juergen Pfister.
      News on October 9 that the government was planning a 10 pct
  withholding tax wiped billions of marks off shares and bonds in
  a market already reeling from rising interest rates at home and
  abroad.
      Bankers said the Bundesbank was angered by the way the
  finance ministry announced the plan -- without consulting the
  Bundesbank adequately, and allowing apparently conflicting
  details to dribble out into an unprepared and uncertain market.
      Both Poehl, 57, and Stoltenberg, 59, have been under
  extraordinary pressures lately.
      Poehl has had to switch to the hard line promoted by his
  deputy, Helmut Schlesinger, jacking up interest rates to fight
  inflationary fears and abandoning the pragmatic policies he had
  pursued so far this year to promote currency stability.
      In recent statements Poehl has sounded more like
  Schlesinger. For years the softly-spoken economist has been
  warning in speech after speech that excessive money supply
  growth would eventually lead to rising prices.
      Schlesinger now has a majority of support in the Bundesbank
  council, and since late summer Poehl has had to represent his
  views, bankers said.
      ""Poehl is in a minority in his own house,"" said Commerzbank's
  Pfister.
      ""Poehl is in a dilemma. He must follow a policy that is not
  entirely his own,"" said another economist.
      The dilemma is that if German interest rates rise too far,
  they will attract funds into the country, pushing up the mark
  and hurting West German exporters.
      The dollar has now shed some seven pfennigs since the
  Bundesbank's new tack became clear in early October.
      Since last Thursday, United States Treasury Secretary James
  Baker has criticized the Bundesbank rate increases.
      Bankers said this could foreshadow a revival of the 1986
  war of words between the U.S. And West Germany, in which U.S.
  Officials talked down the dollar to force West Germany to
  stimulate its economy and thus suck in more U.S. Exports.
      One way West Germany agreed to do this was making a round
  of tax cuts worth 39 billion marks from 1990.
      But financing these tax cuts has proved more difficult for
  Stoltenberg than he had bargained for.
      The cool, unflappable northerner, who was regularly voted
  most popular government politician last year, had to face
  resistance from local barons in the government coalition
  parties and from trade unions to his planned subsidy cuts.
      The withholding tax was intended to plug one gap by raising
  4.3 billion marks.
      But it has caused an outcry among bankers, who say it will
  push up borrowing costs. The extra amount this costs the
  government could wipe out the revenue the tax brings in.
      Meanwhile Stoltenberg is dealing with a local political row
  which has turned into the country's worst political scandal.
      Stoltenberg had to leave monetary talks in Washington last
  month early to sort out a row in the northern state of
  Schleswig-Holstein, where he heads the ruling CDU party.
      The state's CDU premier, Uwe Barschel, had to resign after
  allegations of a ""dirty tricks"" election campaign led to heavy
  losses for the CDU in state elections.
      Barschel was found dead in a hotel bath in Geneva last
  weekend. Police say the death appears to have been suicide.
      Cooperation between Poehl and Stoltenberg is all the more
  remarkable as Poehl is in the opposition Social Democrats, and
  was appointed by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
      When Poehl's contract came up for renewal earlier this
  year, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's CDU-led coalition government
  gave Poehl another eight-year term.
      Werner Chrobok, managing partner at Bethmann Bank, said he
  hoped the two men would soon be of one opinion again.
      But when Poehl criticized Stoltenberg's tax plans he was
  not only voicing what many bankers felt but demonstrating the
  Bundesbank's independence of government, Chrobok said.

"GAF &lt;GAF> PLANS NO CHANGES IF OFFER ACCEPTED
  GAF Corp chairman Samuel Heyman told
  Reuters he did not foresee major changes in Borg-Warner &lt;BOR>
  if GAF's 46 dlr-per-share offer to acquire Borg-Warner is
  successful.
      ""We have great respect for Borg-Warner mangagement,"" Heyman
  said, following a speech at the American Institute of Chemical
  Engineers annual meeting. ""We don't have any particular changes
  in mind.""
      Earlier today, GAF announced that a 3.16-billion-dlr-offer
  was presented to the board of directors of the Chicago-based
  company.
      Last week, GAF had purchased additional shares of the
  company for 40-1/8 dlrs, increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to
  19.9 pct.
      In 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire Union
  Carbide Corp for five billion dlrs, and has since expressed an
  interest in acquiring a chemical company that would complement
  its own chemical business.
      When asked whether GAF would consider selling the
  non-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer is
  accepted, Heyman declined to comment.
      He also refused to say whether GAF would consider
  increasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if the
  initial proposal is rejected.
      Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer to
  Borg-Warner to be a friendly one.
      ""We think we made a fair offer that is good for Borg-Warner
  management and good for its shareholders,"" Heyman said.
       In his speech, Heyman said he feared too many chemical
  companies were attempting to specialize in the same high margin
  niche products.
      He said they were turning their backs on core commodity
  chemical businesses. 
      Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total of
  seven billion dlrs in pre-tax writeoffs during the past two
  years to trim balance sheets.
      He predicted that the U.S. chemical industry, which
  reported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits, would see
  a 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasing
  exports, cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened U.S. dlr.

"GERMAN BANK SEES HIGHER GOLD PRICE FOR 1987
  Gold is expected to continue its rise
  this year due to renewed inflationary pressures, especially in
  the U.S., Hamburg-based Vereins- und Westbank AG said.
      It said in a statement the stabilisation of crude oil
  prices and the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries'
  efforts to achieve further firming of the price has led to
  growing inflationary pressures in the U.S.
      Money supplies in the U.S., Japan and West Germany exceed
  central bank limits and real growth of their gross national
  products, it added.
      Use of physical gold should rise this year due to increased
  industrial demand and higher expected coin production, the bank
  said.
      Speculative demand, which influences the gold price on
  futures markets, has also risen, the bank said.
      These factors and South Africa's unstable political
  situation, which may lead to a temporary reduction in gold
  supplies from that country, underscore the firmer sentiment, it
  said.
      However, Australia's output is estimated to rise to 90
  tonnes this year from 73.5 tonnes in 1986.

"NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN
  The highly visible drama involving the
  yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact
  that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major
  European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
  distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.
      The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
  by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the
  currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
  fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
  trade tensions and imbalances.
      Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
  already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-
  European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.
      In many ways, not least in terms of rare international
  cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between
  the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down
  the value of the dollar was a historic one.
      But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
  currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
  the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
  necessarily central significance, the officials said.
      The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took
  place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement
  simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in
  Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.
      ""You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
  and that was well before Plaza,"" he said.
      On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
  263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was
  242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and
  periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the
  dollar trend has been down, down, down.
      Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross
  rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The
  European currencies are moving back up against the yen.
      The close relationship between exchange rates and trade
  flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
  undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
  changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC
  both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
  This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
      Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of
  of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.
      Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
  pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
  and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
      ""The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a
  tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit
  sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
  to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is
  laying the golden egg,"" said de Hora.
      The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year
  in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
  start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.
      The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than
  U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
  imbalance, and which will cause problems.
      ""This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is
  reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But
  therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive
  edge,"" said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International
  Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. ""If you want
  my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our
  trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
  and this year we may have to do so again,"" he said.

"JAPAN CONSUMER PRICES FALL 0.4 PCT IN JANUARY
  Japan's unadjusted consumer price index

      The fall compares with a decline of 0.2 pct in December.
      The January index compared with a year earlier was down 1.1
  pct, the first drop larger than 1.0 pct since it fell 1.3 pct

  compared with a year earlier but the cost of utilities,
  gasoline and vegetables fell.
      The unadjusted consumer price index for the Tokyo area
  (base 1985) was down 0.1 pct in mid-February from a month
  earlier at 100.2, reflecting lower prices for food, clothing
  and footwear. Compared with a year earlier, the index was down
